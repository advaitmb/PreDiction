    "title": "Before Sunrise",
    "text": "A beautiful film, Before Sunrise is a purely realistic romantic movie with protagonists who fall in l love with each other on a train to Vienna. In my opinion, it is a classic no melodrama, saving one another or phony violence romantic film. I have never watched a romantic film that has been able to keep the audience engaged throughout the movie without any violence, drama. Overall a very heartwarming, practical and a romantic movie.\nThe plot goes around two young people- Jesse an American man and Celine, a French student in their mid 20s who meet on a train to Vienna. They start talking and take a few coffees on the train when Jesse suggests that Celine should get off the train at Vienna and spend time with him till he takes his flight. This is how the movie is named \"Before Sunrise\". They talk about all sorts of things in that little time they have together and fall in love. Richard Linklater, the director of this movie likes his own way of letting time unfold the characters as they cross paths and start talking to each other.\nThis movie has a bittersweet but a very realistic and practical end as both the protagonists part ways, still in love, accepting that all they had was the most memorable time before sunrise.",

Overall a very heartwarming, practical and a romantic movie\\nThe plot goes around two young people- Jesse an American man and Celine, a French student in their mid 20s who meet on a train to Vienna. They start talking and take a few coffees on the train when Jesse suggests that Celine should get off the train at Vienna and spend time with him till he takes his flight. This is how the movie is named \\\"Before Sunrise\\\". They talk about all sorts of things in that little time they have together and fall in love. Richard Linklater, the director of this movie likes his own way of letting time unfold the characters as they cross paths and start talking to each other.\\nThis movie has a bittersweet but a very realistic and practical end as both the protagonists part ways, still in love, accepting that all they had was the most memorable time before sunrise. \"}"
