    "text": "The movie is about a guy named Larry, who is hired to kidnap the brother of a powerful federal prosecutor who is also psychologically challenged. The man who hires him also appoints a girl named Rikki to help him assist with the kidnapping. She is gifted with a amazing looks and a bold, dominant personality. But the story gets turn when the Larry starts falling for her which could be dangerous for their job. The movie somehow doesn't hold you with the story and have some references left unexplained. Overall after the abduction of the boy the movie lacks to show the atmosphere of panic and fear, among the character as they roam freely in public. Some of the scenes in the movie are  little extra and do not add up that much to the overall story. Talking about the story, that is what it lacks in. The movie has poor built up of few or non the less any thrill packed surprising scenes. The story proceeds in a steady and constant pace which sometimes can be a little off putting. And also the characters other than the main three lack any real character development. Most of the remaining characters of the movie play a cameo role than to actually contribute to the story line. Though the movie stars well known actors, the movie performs badly in the story department where one misses out on the thrill, surprise and action thus limiting the potential of the actors and actresses. I would not recommend the movie unless one is die hard fan of the cast.",
