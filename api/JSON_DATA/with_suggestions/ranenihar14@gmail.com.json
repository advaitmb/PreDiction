    "text": "A very basic mainstream plot and ameture acting and writing skills is what the movie is about. The pace of the movie is very uneven. Some parts are stretched a lot whereas some scenes are too fast forward. The movie is about a young girl who makes her way from a background dancer to a famous singer with a help of another singer who she later falls in love with. The acting of all the characters is somewhat disappointing throughout the film.\nThere was no drama, no proper romance, nothing intriguing at all about the film. It was just a bunch of people trying to get together and figure out how to make it work. All the scenes are very abrupt, like how the mother just sends her girl to the foster without any hesitation, how Billie ( Mariah Carey) signs big albums easily without any struggle. Honestly the only obstacle that she has to overcome is her overprotective boyfriend. Whenever there is a film about how a person becomes a star from nothing has to have ups and downs while was completely missing in this film. They have tried to show too much in a very less time, hence no scene from the movie was really impactful. The film is a classic example of how movies don't work just by signing a big singer or any artist for that matter.",
