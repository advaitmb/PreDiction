    "text": "Pride and Prejudice is a romantic drama film which is based on a novel of the same name. The backdrop is set in the 18th century England. The story is about how Elizabeth meets a rich and proud Mr. Darcy and how the romance turns into a twisted love affair. \nThe cast is just superb. They make you feel all the emotions for real. All the actors have done a good job.\nThe script is as good as the direction. Both are subtle and well realized. \nApart from being a Good movie it lacked some of the charm. It surely is good but not memorable.\nThe film rushed through at an alarming pace without really getting to know any character but still\nthe story was slow and a bit serious which makes it a one time watch movie.\n\nOverall a good romantic story line, a dramatic one indeed but with a slight lack of charm.\n\n",
