It starts out with Jesse Wallace meeting a girl Celine on a train journey in Europe , and later we see him fall in love with her. \nafter seeing a significant connection with Celine , he convinces her to roam around ans spend a day in Vienna with him. it is a film where both of the lead characters are talking about the most random yet systematized things in life. the movie relies heavily on the ideas that these 2 characters have throughout their journey in Vienna.It documents the life changing events of adventure before the 2 of them fall in love with each other just before Jesse has to return home.the film is very soulful and touching without any complicated scenes.on the base the movie states that the two of them are destined to become a couple but hesitate to express themselves because of certain factors. its a story which is a compilation of small memorable scenes and force the audience of the movie to relate with the lives of Celine and Jesse. it Shows how well 2 people not knowing each other can connect with each other if there are no distractions.",
