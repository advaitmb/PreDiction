    "text": "Gigli, the name itself sounds absurd. The movie tries to do something different, thoughtful, and interesting but it doesn't quite work. Nevertheless, the movie is worth watching sheerly due to some scenes which propagate valuable realism in the viewer's mind. The star cast of the film is pretty good, but it falls short in making the movie cohesive. \n\nThe protagonist, Larry Gigli, is an errand boy for a mobster, who has been assigned to carry out a task. However, the mobster has another woman to keep an eye on him. They both together have to look after the kidnapped kid, Brian. This seems to be a very cliche setup. But, Gigli plays it differently, and the movie treads a different path.  Throughout the entire film,  the viewer is surprised to witness the uniqueness of the plot and the characters. There are scenes that are quite unexpected and uplift the movie on an emotional level, however, there seems to be no connection between them and the rest of the storyline. \n\nThere are some quite interesting thoughts about the female sexual assertion and male surrender, but they aren't given enough justice and are left hanging halfway. Overall, the film does a very good job of triggering unique, unexpected ideas, but fails miserably to give a proper end to it. A good example of a job well begun but left incomplete.",
