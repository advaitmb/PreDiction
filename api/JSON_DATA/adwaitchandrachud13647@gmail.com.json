    "text": "Adaptation of the book The Pride and The Prejudice by author Jane Austen, the 2005 movie Pride and Prejudice does not match the hype it created.Extremely slow paced and unorganized character development makes the movie an unpleasant experience to watch.\nThe story begins outside of London with Mrs Bennet ,her 5 daughters and her urge to marry them with Mr. Bingley a man with a biig fortune. While the sisters Jane and Elizabeth are caught in the system which prioritizes wealth over honour the film glorifies this concept and conveys a strong message to the audience.\nM.r Bingley grows fond of Jane at the same time Elizabeth has her moments with Mr. Darcy , Mr. Bingleys friend who however ignores Elizabeth and refuses to dance with her. Soon Mr. Bennets distant cousin while paying a visit to Mr. Bennet's home asks Elizabeth to marry him .Characters like Mr. Bingley's sisters and Mr. Wickham also play an important role in the story.\nIn the end Darcy accepts his fault, tells Elizabeth that he still likes her ;Bingley proposes to Jane and both of the Bennet sisters get married and Mr. bennet is glad with the fact his daughters have been married happily.\nKeiara Knightleys portrayal of Elizabeth is the only thing that makes the film worth watching.",
