    "text": "Movie : Glitter \n\nGlitter is a 2001 movie based on the life of a girl named Billie who has faced a rough childhood and copes it up with it her beautiful voice just like that of her mother's. The movie also portraits a beautiful relations between her and her two best friends which are also her family. Her talent of singing gets into lime light once she meets DJ / Boyfriend / love Dice. The movie is centered upon success that she achieves through her beautiful voice and the love story between Billie and Dice. The movie has some long shots with no dialogues which can sometimes  be a bit boring and stretched but overall it is \" okay \" film with songs from late 90's. It actually displays a nice portrayal of a transition of rags to riches and how it suddenly affected her life and the people around her. The movie is a bit slow in pace which can sometimes make you you lose attention. Some of the characters of the movie have had a great potential for more character built-up which includes her mother and best friends and but in the story line they are side tracked a little extra. Along with the 90's romantic vibe the movie has some amazing tunes and songs and moderate typical storyline. It is a good watch if your interested into old retro style movies. Overall its a classic romantic movie with a few twist and turns.",
