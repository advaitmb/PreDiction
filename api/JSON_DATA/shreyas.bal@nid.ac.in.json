    "text": "Glitter- Movie review\n\nGlitter seems to be a very catchy and attractive name for a film. However, the excitement doesn't last long once the film progresses into the storyline. The intent of the movie seems very simple, which is depicting the reality of life as it is, unfiltered, through the lens of a young budding singer, aiming to make it big in the industry.\n\nThe plot starts with the journey of a  nightclub singer and her daughter, Billie(the protagonist). Billie is sent away by her mother at a very early age to an orphanage. That's when her journey starts. Along the entire journey, Billie comes across numerous personas and characters. One, amongst them, happens to be Billie's boyfriend turned producer. The film depicts unfiltered emotions and feelings, the protagonist and the supporting characters would feel, as they experience the journey from rags to stardom. \n\nThe way Billies' boyfriend is shown getting insecure once she starts getting popular is an apt representation of how people feel. This is perhaps the only great learning one can derive from the film which is- Succes, fame, popularity is always accompanied by emotions like envy, insecurities. Brilliantly shown how people succumb to them, getting too insecure and losing faith in their partner. \n\nExcept for its accurate portrayal of how life is, and how do different people experience it, the movie fails drastically to engage the audience. The plot seems to be more or less predictable, with very cliche moments of joy and sorrow, love, and jealousy. The way in which the whole journey has been portrayed isn't much exciting and doesn't include moments of surprise. \n\nOverall, the film could've been executed and made with a well-planned plot along with twists and turns rather than going for a bit too real depiction of reality.\n",
