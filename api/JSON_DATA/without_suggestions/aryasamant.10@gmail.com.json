You can't help it but listen while they talk.\nThe Direction is the main element here. Everything is well executed and looks perfect on screen. Everything is put together outstandingly in this movie by Linklater. They way he portrays all the locations will surely make you want to visit all those places.\n\nThroughout the film, we see Jesse and Celine walk through the streets of Vienna and the development of their bond is shown in a very subtle manner. You can easily notice how they are falling in love in this journey.\nThe dialogues are exceptionally well written with a mix of humor, philosophy, spontaneity and subtlety.\nThe combination of an amazing soundtrack with a phenomenal cinematography guides you through the streets of Vienna with the characters.\n\nOverall, the movie is simple, raw and amusing at the same time. It is a fabulous take on modern love story. \nIt's away from all the glitters and glamours which makes it an art piece. ",
