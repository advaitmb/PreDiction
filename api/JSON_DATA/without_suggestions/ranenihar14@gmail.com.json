    "text": "An okayish plot with a bad execution is what sums up the movie 'Gigli' for me. 'Romance/ Comedy' is the genre the film is aiming at but it does not satisfy either of the criteria properly. The comic dialogues and the references are not of everyone's taste and they go unnoticed most of the time. As far as romance is concerned, the movie is neither a proper romantic film so if you're going for that don't keep high expectations. The plot is very simple and light without any major twists or turns. \nBen Affleck plays Gigli who is a hitman working under a gangster named Louis (Lenny Vito) who is trying to do a favor for Satrkman. A New York city mob boss currently on a string of criminal charges. To end that Louis commands Gigli to kidnap the mentally handicapped brother of a federal prosecutor, assuming that will give Starkman leverage. \nThe criminal based scenes seem very less impactful and easy going such as when Gigli goes to kidnap the handicapped brother, he convinces Brian (Justin Bartha) very easily to come with him by promising to take him to  Baywatch. Shortly thereafter Ricki (Lopez) shows up at Gigli's place who is also sent by Louis and informs Gigli that she is stuck with him until the mission is over. Then the film revolves around how they spend the rest of the time sharing space with each other until the mission is over.\nSome of the scenes featuring Gigli and Ricki are stretched way too much unnecessarily increasing the overall length of the movie for no reason. The bond between Ricki and Gigli is sweet but it misses the drama and action required in such a film. ",

To end that Louis commands Gigli to kidnap the mentally handicapped brother of a federal prosecutor, assuming that will give Starkman leverage. \\nThe criminal based scenes seem very less impactful and easy going such as when Gigli goes to kidnap the handicapped brother, he convinces Brian (Justin Bartha) very easily to come with him by promising to take him to  Baywatch. Shortly thereafter Ricki (Lopez) shows up at Gigli's place who is also sent by Louis and informs Gigli that she is stuck with him until the mission is over. Then the film revolves around how they spend the rest of the time sharing space with each other until the mission is over.\\nSome of the scenes featuring Gigli and Ricki are stretched way too much unnecessarily increasing the overall length of the movie for no reason. The bond between Ricki and Gigli is sweet but it misses the drama and action required in such a film \",\"last key\":190,\"selection start\":1597,\"selection end\":1597,\"deletes\":42,\"typed\":355,\"partially deleted\":33}"
