    "text": "The actors Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez have played a decent role from their end in the movie Gigli. However, the storyline is not that interesting. Larry Gigli is played by Affleck who is a hitman who kidnaps a dyslexic kid named Brian as per the orders of his client Louis. The kid is the brother of a prosecutor and is therefore held as leverage against some felony Louis has committed. Ricky played by Lopez assists Larry who is also hired by Louis. During this time Larry comes to know that Ricky is a lesbian. They develop love interests for each other later. Both develop a soft corner for the kid. The kid is a big fan of the bay watch and wants to visit the shooting set of the same. The good things about the movie according to me are, they have acknowledged and normalized the terms considered taboo- Dyslexia and Lesbianism. Otherwise, the whole movie just revolves around 3 people. There are a lot of loose ends in the movie like what happened with the court case going on? Did Brian's brother drop charges? Is Louis in jail serving his time? Where did Larry and Ricky go? and many more. There was no violence shown in the movie which is good. At the start of the movie, one tends to predict that it is comedy based but later shit gets serious and ends abruptly. Overall, it is kind of a 1-time watch movie though I would not recommend it to anyone. Also, I would rate it 4/10.",

Larry Gigli is played by Affleck who is a hitman who kidnaps a dyslexic kid named Brian as per the orders of his client Louis. The kid is the brother of a prosecutor and is therefore held as leverage against some felony Louis has committed. Ricky played by Lopez assists Larry who is also hired by Louis. During this time Larry comes to know that Ricky is a lesbian. They develop love interests for each other later. Both develop a soft corner for the kid. The kid is a big fan of the bay watch and wants to visit the shooting set of the same. The good things about the movie according to me are, they have acknowledged and normalized the terms considered taboo- Dyslexia and Lesbianism. Otherwise, the whole movie just revolves around 3 people. There are a lot of loose ends in the movie like what happened with the court case going on? Did Brian's brother drop charges? Is Louis in jail serving his time? Where did Larry and Ricky go? and many more. There was no violence shown in the movie which is good. At the start of the movie, one tends to predict that it is comedy based but later shit gets serious and ends abruptly.

        "{\"text\":\"The actors Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez have played a decent role from their end in the movie Gigli. However, the storyline is not that interesting. Larry Gigli is played by Affleck who is a hitman who kidnaps a dyslexic kid named Brian as per the orders of his client Louis. The kid is the brother of a prosecutor and is therefore held as leverage against some felony Louis has committed. Ricky played by Lopez assists Larry who is also hired by Louis. During this time Larry comes to know that Ricky is a lesbian. They develop love interests for each other later. Both develop a soft corner for the kid. The kid is a big fan of the bay watch and wants to visit the shooting set of the same. The good things about the movie according to me are, they have acknowledged and normalized the terms considered taboo- Dyslexia and Lesbianism. Otherwise, the whole movie just revolves around 3 people. There are a lot of loose ends in the movie like what happened with the court case going on? Did Brian's brother drop charges? Is Louis in jail serving his time? Where did Larry and Ricky go? and many more. There was no violence shown in the movie which is good. At the start of the movie, one tends to predict that it is comedy based but later shit gets serious and ends abruptly.

Otherwise, the whole movie just revolves around 3 people. There are a lot of loose ends in the movie like what happened with the court case going on? Did Brian's brother drop charges? Is Louis in jail serving his time? Where did Larry and Ricky go? and many more. There was no violence shown in the movie which is good. At the start of the movie, one tends to predict that it is comedy based but later shit gets serious and ends abruptly. Overall, it is kind of a 1-time watch movie though I would not recommend it to anyone. Also, I would rate it 3/10\",\"last key\":1,\"selection start\":1388,\"selection end\":1388,\"deletes\":30,\"typed\":303,\"partially deleted\":26}",
        "{\"text\":\"The actors Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez have played a decent role from their end in the movie Gigli. However, the storyline is not that interesting. Larry Gigli is played by Affleck who is a hitman who kidnaps a dyslexic kid named Brian as per the orders of his client Louis. The kid is the brother of a prosecutor and is therefore held as leverage against some felony Louis has committed. Ricky played by Lopez assists Larry who is also hired by Louis. During this time Larry comes to know that Ricky is a lesbian. They develop love interests for each other later. Both develop a soft corner for the kid. The kid is a big fan of the bay watch and wants to visit the shooting set of the same. The good things about the movie according to me are, they have acknowledged and normalized the terms considered taboo- Dyslexia and Lesbianism.
