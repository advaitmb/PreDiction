    "text": "This movie is an adaptation of the beautiful novel by author Jane Austen. The film starts with the beautiful scene showcasing lush green meadows while Elizabeth Bennett walks through it, reading a book. Elizabeth is a young, beautiful woman with four sisters. Her mother (Brenda Bennett) is shown to be a character who wants to try everything to get all her daughters married away to gentlemen, while the father is shown to be a calm yet humorous man. The movie revolves around three families : the Bennetts, the Bingleys and Mr. Darcy.\nThe movie is a beautiful projector of new, tender romance. A few scenes where the slightest touch of the other person feels like butterflies in your stomach. This movie is a good screen version of the romance, misjudgments, mishaps because of the mix of rich and the perceived poor and humor.\nThe plot also showcases a strong headed female character : Elizabeth, who has her own ways of humor, being stubborn, proud and romantic just as Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy's character is very closed and is revealed slowly as the plot moves forward.\nThe entire feel given to the movie with the costumes, young women reading books, dancing in meadows as their skirts sway with the wind gives just the right amount of  drama to the plot along with romance.",
