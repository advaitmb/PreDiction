1,Organizing the annual housing surveys as a very large relationally oriented data base,"['Andrew A. Beveridge', 'Jennifer A. Norris']",https://doi.org/10.1145/800275.810923,"Since 1973, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, through the Bureau of the Census, has conducted a yearly nationwide survey of housing. Data on a wide range of topics are collected during face to face interviews with over 190,000 individuals. Plainly, the Annual Housing Surveys represent one of the largest longitudinal general social and economic data collection efforts ever undertaken.Due to changing policy and substantive interests, as well as government requirements, the interview schedules have changed significantly from year to year. Since the great potential for data from the Annual Housing Survey is in longitudinal analysis, it is necessary to have common variable definitions and consistent formats.To accomplish this, we have developed and implemented a system which includes: 1) documentation of the variables, questionnaires, and files across all years and surveys; 2) files created using one homogeneously defined data structure; 3) a simple system to produce custom user files; 4) a method to easily produce routine custom analyses and tabulations using the data.We have applied the relational model to create a small data base which documents the interview schedules, files and variable definitions. From this we produce up to date documentation and computer programs which are used to update the Annual Housing Survey data base, to handle custom file requests, and to perform analyses.",0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

The data source for the samples is the microfilmed original Population Schedules which contain the census enumerator's recording of household information. The procedure to sample the universe of household listings and transcribe the sample households' data is described in the paper. A pretest of the 1940 Public Use Sample included a comparison of three methods of sampling and transcription. The results of this comparison are reported. The applicability of these procedures to similar projects is discussed.,0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

Zartman']",https://doi.org/10.1145/800275.810925,"The May 1981 Survey will mark the 152nd Survey of Consumer Attitudes. Initiated in 1946, the purpose of the surveys is to measure changes in consumer attitudes and expectations, to understand why these changes occur, and to evaluate how they relate to consumer decisions to save, to borrow, or to make discretionary purchases under changing conditions.Each survey contains approximately 40 core questions, each of which probes a different aspect of consumer confidence. Open-ended questions are asked concerning evaluations of expectations about personal finances, employment, price changes, and the national business situation. Additional questions probe for the respondents appraisal of present market conditions for houses, and other durables. Demographic data obtained in these surveys include income, age, sex, race, education, and occupation, among others. While many questions designed to measure change in attitudes and behavior are repeated in identical form in each survey, special questionnaire supplements are added to most surveys by outside sponsors on a time share basis. Supplements to the ongoing surveys give sponsors prompt turnaround to survey materials while taking advantage of shared field expenses. When the research task is first undertaken, a maximum amount of time and effort can be spent in developing these survey materials, not in establishing and setting in motion standard sampling and interviewing procedures, questionnaire and code development for standard demographic items, and so forth.Although each survey task is unique in its time requirements, shared time participation on the ongoing Surveys of Consumer Attitudes is an effective and flexible approach for meeting many research needs. Current procedures include production of a fully documented computer data file available for analytic use within 48 hours of the close of interviewing. Within one week of the close of the survey, a report containing tabulations and charts of questions asked is sent to the sponsors.",0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

Traugott']",https://doi.org/10.1145/800275.810926,"The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) is a data archive and repository for social science data. A major function of the ICPSR is to disseminate the data holdings in a reasonably standard format. For holdings that will be extensively used, additional effort is made to prepare comprehensive, machine-readable documentation, to cross-check the documentation against the data for accuracy and consistency, and to correct or document any inconsistencies discovered.In the past, ""cleaning"" and documenting the data involved using a number of different computer programs. A great deal of human time was expended on procedural matters: which programs to use, when to use them, and how to coordinate the various stages of the cleaning process. As staff costs and the number of new acquisitions skyrocketed, and computers increased in power and decreased in cost, it became imperative to automate as much as possible the procedure for preparing data for distribution. The GIDO software was developed to meet this need.GIDO is an interactive multi-function program package that guides staff members through the procedure for documenting and cleaning social science data. A cohesive history of the processing operations performed on the data is maintained automatically in machine-readable form. Video terminals are used to display ""forms"" which the staff fill out with the textual and technical documentation for the data. GIDO immediately verifies the contents of each form and provides an opportunity to make corrections. The forms allow the input of information without requiring knowledge of specialized syntax and conventions. After all documentary materials have been entered, GIDO checks the data for consistency with the original documentation, corrects or flags discrepancies encountered, reformats the data using uniform conventions, and produces machine-readable documentation in a form ready for dissemination.Use of GIDO enables the ICPSR archive to perform its data processing functions more efficiently and at lower cost, thus permitting the organization to meet ever-increasing demands on its resources.",0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

Computers now help store, manage, duplicate and interpret vast quantities of data with an ease and relative economy undreamed of in the past. These developments have, over the years, fostered the growth of new research methods in a variety of fields, including the social sciences. Large and more complex bodies of quantitative data have been collected as social scientists seek ways to understand human behavior with empirical research methods and scientific sampling techniques. In addition to collecting their own data, researchers have also utilized vast amounts of machine-readable data that have been prepared by other researchers, governmental agencies, and private organizations.The changes in the computing industry combined with the increased demand for services have made it feasible for organizations to consider automating as many tasks as possible.

The surveys are designed to explore why changes in consumer attitudes and expectations occur, and how these changes influence consumer spending and saving decisions. A major research objective of the project is to use this collected data to evaluate economic trends and prospects.Each survey contains ""standard"" questions asked at regular intervals, many of which have been included from the project's inception. The aggregated results of these surveys provide a wealth of time-series data with the potential to be an important factor in forecasting consumer behavior. The ""standard"" questions themselves can be disseminated into approximately 190 separate data series (including index transformations). When ""nonstandard"" (or non-core) questions are included, this total jumps considerably. With such a large number of data variables, many different areas of analysis are available to be researched. When the many macro-economic data series (e.g., Federal Reserve, Census, or Retail Sales data) are added to this compilation, the data management problems increase.

10,Bibliometric analysis of isi's Arts & Humanities Citation index,"['Morton V. Malin', 'Martha C. Dean']",https://doi.org/10.1145/800275.810933,"Bibliometrics, the quantitative study of literature, has made a considerable contribution to the management of scientific libraries and to the understanding of the sociology of science. It has joined operations research as effective management tools in making substantial impact on optimization of library services, resources sharing and allocation in library networks. With the common belief that humanistic literatures are different, these analytic techniques have not been applied to any extent. We believe that although sociological factors may impact on the humanities in different ways, patterns of regularity in communication, individual contribution, and literature growth shall be studied. Knowledge of the characteristics of humanistic literatures may enable us to improve information access and to maximize available resources in space, manpower, and funds for books. A pilot study has been attempted on a bibliography of the history of the American Revolution.The data base is constructed from the Writings on American History: A Subject Bibliography of Articles under the heading ""Revolution &amp; Confederation (1763-1789)"". To facilitate the analysis, the data management program FAMULUS was used.Selected Results: 1095 articles were published between 1962-1976 by 790 authors in 224 journals or publishing sources. The average author productivity is 1.39 which is similar to other fields studied. As expected, a few highly prolific authors dominated the field, and their productivity distribution follows the well-known Lotka's Law. The dispersion of publications over journals also adheres to Bradford's distribution, identifying the most productive journal in this field as the William and Mary Quarterly. Thus, scholarship in general assumes certain common characteristics regardless of the discipline. Yet differences exist. There are only 77 (10%) authors who have ever co-authored in a mere 47 (4%) of the total literature. This is a dramatic departure from the intensely collaborative enterprise of science in which almost all scientific writers co-author.From our experience, FAMULUS is a useful tool in bibliometric analysis in addition to being a good personal documentation system to replace our shoebox of cards. We have also used it in the teaching of indexing and retrieval of documents.",0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

14,The text's the thing: Concordances to literary texts (abstract only),['Michael Preston'],https://doi.org/10.1145/800275.810935,"The history of computer-generated concordances is already one-third of a century long. Thousands of concordances have been generated; many have been published. Most of these are useful, but there are limitations to all of them. In this presentation I discuss a number of variations on concordance-making based on specific projects being carried out at the University of Colorado.A word-form concordance can be of considerable utility. Particularly for older states of language of which our knowledge is often less than perfect, this ""primary"" concordance form seems best for initial circulation, but such a concordance is insensitive to variants and ambiguities. It is often as suggestive of what might have been done as it is directly useful.With the increasing availability of microcomputers and various kinds of remote terminals, it is now possible to remove many of the difficulties of text-editing so that a ""secondary"" concordance edited toward particular applications can be produced more readily. At the University of Colorado, at which the majority of humanists who use computers wish to make maximum use of the available technology without becoming computing scientists, I have found it practical to suggest a particular synthesis of batch and interactive computing. This involves the use of a retrieval, concordance-generating, and editing system so modular in design that editorial intervention is practical at many points. This editing makes use of device-dependent text editors of sufficient sophistication that the user perceives little of the technical operation beyond requesting his programs and his text; otherwise he has the freedom of a typewriter coupled to the benefits of a screen for displaying modifications to his text as they are made, whether directly by him or by a variety of programmed functions. Stations built around ""smart"" terminals as well as ""dumb"" terminals with microcomputer and floppy disks are operational.Thus it is now more practical to produce second-generation concordances which more nearly reflect the perceived needs of a scholarly community: words may be (manually) disambiguated by meaning and function, contexts may be edited either to omit extraneous material or insert explanatory matter, and words may be clustered by dictionary or thesaurus. The result is concordances of far greater utility in specific areas and more meaningful statistics.The development of better equipment and new techniques has made it possible to interact more thoroughly with one's text. There is no need for premature data reduction, but rather the encouragement of what I call the ""infinite loop of literary scholarship"": one works with one's texts to produce results which suggesst work to produce more results which suggest still more work .... The newer technology seems to fit the humanist far better than did the old.",0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

This is due to the fact that there are no standardized word lists which can be expected to meet the scope of all art collections. Whereas tailoring subject terms to the scope of a given collection is the most practical approach for the curator in charge of the collection, the researcher, who may not be an art specialist, often is frustrated when the listing of subject terms does not include the terms relevant for his/her purposes. This presentation will explore how the development of a thesaurus resolves the conflict of subject vocabulary. Specific examples will be drawn from four computer projects at the National Museum of American Art. Each of the projects varies in scope, yet a single subject classification guide has been developed for purposes of providing subject access to the contents of each project.Because a separate subject word list was not originally designed for each project, a thesaurus is now being developed which will allow for a listing of terms not used for indexing but which are relevant to both the scope of each project and anticipated researcher needs.From a practical viewpoint, the presentation will demonstrate how the computer can be used to generate terminology to be included in the thesaurus.",2,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

19,Folk (abstract only),['Jan Oldervoll'],https://doi.org/10.1145/800275.810940,"Ethnography is a methodology which emphasises a ""soft"" interpretative approach to social reality. It is often portrayed as being at the opposite pole to quantitative approaches as exemplified in the classic Merton-Lazarsfeld paradigm (Structural-Functionalism wedded to the survey method).Ethnography is a method in which the researcher actively engages in and records the life of a social group. This record of experience is essentially qualitative. It is primarily constructed in the form of textual description: an ongoing account of a person's observations, thoughts and feelings while in the ""field"". This text is usually given the generic title of field-notes.The Ethnographic researcher is therefore normally confronted with a vast amount of textual data. To get some understanding of, and control over this data, the Ethnographer must in some way split up this record of raw experience. He must in some way ""chunk"" up his data into easily manageable units or categories. It is this classificatory activity which forms the basis of Ethnographic analysis.In greater detail, Ethnographic data analysis may be generally portrayed as consisting of three analytically distinct, but empirically indistinct activities: represents a1. The reading of field-notes, accompanied by the recording of themes and hypotheses;2. The coding of important topics observed within the field-notes under different category headings;3. The disassembling of field-notes by coded category; the purpose being the creative filing and retrieving of one's data.The prime concern of this presentation will be to discuss means by which such analysis may be accomplished.It is the author's belief that the schema shown below possible evolutionary trend in Ethnographic data analysis: items lower down the schema give the Ethnographer greater power and flexibility in the way he handles text. Reference will be made to presently ongoing research at Cardiff as evidence of this claim.1. The Traditional Filing Cabinet.a. Simple chronological filing of text.b.

20,Initial experiences with an on-line catalog (abstract only),"['Rebecca D. Dixon', 'Edmund D. Meyers']",https://doi.org/10.1145/800275.810942,"P-STAT began as a collection of integrated commands which read rectangular files sequentially. A simple modification language for recoding and case selection was added in the late 1960's. Commands were added throughout the 1970's. Recently, however, a major effort has gone into language enhancement and file structure improvements.P-RADE, a random access data enhancement to P-STAT, is an example. This type of file structure supports up to 10 indexing keys, allowing a case or a group of cases to be accessed very rapidly. In addition, any P-STAT command can read a P-RADE file sequentially in any key order.In some ways, this approach blends aspects of database technology into statistical software. Examples of its use will be given.",0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

The background of the library automation project -- including issues of cost-effectiveness, increased power, and user utility--is discussed in order to establish the initial goals of this activity. Then, attention is given to how the project was implemented; this includes a comparison of preliminary goals with what ultimately was delivered. The transition from a COM catalog to the on-line catalog required training of patrons (some of whom had little or no experience with a computer terminal), and only half of the Center staff participated in the initial training sessions. Preliminary patron behavior is reviewed, and an attempt to informally analyze both positive and negative experiences is offered.

22,"Urben research in ethnic, demographic and household-economic structures with small area, micro-databases (abstract only)","['Harold Benenson', 'Steven Just']",https://doi.org/10.1145/800275.810943,"Computerized U.S. Census data has been most widely used for (1)
employment, fertility, demographic and stratification research
involving Public Use Sample (PUS) microdata on the national level,
and (2) applied research (for planning, administration, marketing,
and other applications) with summary (aggregated) data for
localized (i.e., block, tract, community, etc.) geographic units. A
third, highly productive avenue of research, involving Census PUS
micro-data for localized urban units (i.e., SMSAs, counties and
especially selected large-city neighborhoods), has not received the
attention it merits, either among sophisticated public data users
or among novice users.Three forms of current or future small area,
Census microdata constitute resources for urban research. First,
conventional 1970 Census PUS data sets are available for counties
and/or SMSAs (with minimum populations of 250,000). Second, special
tabulations for the two largest U.S. cities permit analysis of 1970
household and person records group by (sub-county) urban
neighborhoods (27 in New York City; 12 in Chicago). Third, 1980
Census microdata, by allowing identification of geographic areas of
smaller population size (100,000 population), will vastly expand
the applications of localized research with the conventional PUS or
special tabulations. In addition, the 1980 PUS microdata will, for
the first time, allow comparative time-series analyses of county
(or SMSA) area populations, over the 1970-1980 decade.In contrast
to national PUS microdata research, local level analyses have the
advantages of (1) smaller data set size and processing costs, (2)
more immediate integration of computerized research hypotheses with
additional sources of (qualitative) information and questions
(stemming from direct knowledge of the communities studied), and
(3) increased ability to zero in on specialized ethnic,
occupational-industrial, migrant, age, etc. urban population groups
which are disproportionately represented in particular local
environments. Our own research projects (at various stages of
development) which attempt to exploit these advantages include
computerized analysis of:1. Patterns of household composition, and
source and structure of family income, among Upper East Side and
Upper West Side Manhattan residents with family incomes of $
50,000. or more (as reported in the 1970 Census)2. Employment
patterns of married women of Cuban immigrant background, in
relation to family class position and period of immigration, for
Hudson County, New Jersey3. Contrasts in the occupational positions
and household patterns of first-generation and second-generation
husbands and wives of Italian background in a New York City working
class community (Astoria-Long Island City, Queens)4. Wives'
employment patterns in relation to ethnic background and husbands'
occupations and income levels in a working class community located
in a manufacturing center (South Side, Chicago)5. Change in the
social and demographic characteristics of succeeding groups of
migrants to an expanding ""sunbelt"" metropolitan area (Albuquerque,
New Mexico)6. Contrasts in local housing markets and housing
availability, involving analysis of the number and characteristics
of vacant housing units for New Jersey counties.These, as well as
other projects we have assisted, have been undertaken with varied
software resources, including packages (such as CENTS-AID) with
unique hierarchical file processing capabilities, as well as more
versatile (non-hierarchical), general purpose packages (such as
SPSS). The advantages and research applications of small area,
micro-databases can be realized with a range of software techniques

24,Making computer capabilities accessible to musicians (abstract only),['Ann K. Blombach'],https://doi.org/10.1145/800275.810945,"During the past ten years at The Ohio State University we have developed a large library of music-related computer programs, encompassing many aspects of music scholarship. These programs include procedures for performing basic music analysis functions as well as programs for information retrieval. We have also prepared a considerable library of encoded musical data and bibliographic information. All our programs and data are stored on disks on OSU's Amdahl 470, making them immediately accessible to any computer programmer who has been initiated into the mysteries of manipulating disk-stored data sets. We wanted, however, to make everything equally accessible to those musicians who are not particularly interested in mastering the complexities of computers, but who would nevertheless like to make use of computer-produced results. We have taken two significant steps toward solving this difficult problem:1. SLAM (Simple Language for Analyzing Music), a ""super-high-level"" language written in SPITBOL by Thomas G. Whitney (formerly on the staff of OSU's Instruction and Research Computer Center). With SLAM, the musician specifies which music analysis procedures and which musical data he would like to use, communicating with the computer in normal English using traditional music analysis terminology. Though he must satisfy certain syntactical requirements and must include certain key words, such constraints are minimal. For example, ""Please count the intervals in the alto voice of Bach's chorale 308."" and ""Count intervals alto 308."" are both legal SLAM commands which would produce the same results. SLAM translates the user's request into the appropriate job control language statements which call the programs and data necessary to perform the task.2. IRRS (Information Retrieval Request System), written in SPITBOL, currently under development. This system provides access to different types of bibliographic, textual, and descriptive data stored on the computer. The user makes his request in the appropriate format, and the computer executes the steps necessary to produce the requested information. For example, in order to retrieve a bibliography of books and articles written between 1960 and 1970, dealing with the perception of music intervals, the user enters ""keyterm: perception, music intervals"" and ""year: 1960-1970"" from a computer terminal. The terminal then prints a list of books and articles meeting these criteria.SLAM has been very succesful. Not only have the non-computer-programmers found SLAM invaluable, but even our musician-programmers have found it much easier to access existing programs through SLAM. The information retrieval programs are well under way, and we expect them to be equally useful in providing access to research materials. In short, we are achieving our goals: 1) to make available a variety of computer procedures and data to computer-shy musicians and 2) to eliminate the fears, disappointments, and general confusion too often associated with musicians' attempts to use computers.",0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

25,Requirements for improving the use of computers to support the development of policy decisions (abstract only),['John Henize'],https://doi.org/10.1145/800275.810946,"Computer based information systems have been developed and used successfully for production and engineering and for lower level management tasks but they have yet to be widely applied to aiding management decision making at the higher policy making levels. Despite many attempts, the failures have been many and the successes few. This has resulted in large part from the fact that the technicians who have been engaged to design such systems have not correctly understood the nature of the problem environment with which they are dealing. Because they themselves have had no experience at the policy making levels, they have had a poor conception of the problems to be solved, and thus have made mistakes which they would not have made, had they been designing an information system for lower level tasks. In designing an inventory or process control system, for instance, the technicians have carefully studied the nature of the problems to be dealt with, and have decided which information is important and which not. They have not, in these cases, delivered reams of superfluous information to every point in the system. But when designing an information system to aid higher level decision making, they have tended to do the exact opposite. They have attempted to put every conceivable piece of information that could possibly be of the most remote interest at the fingertips of each and every policy maker -- each of whom is already suffering from a severe information overload. The decision maker could never possibly begin to digest all of this information, even if he found it useful, which, in general, he does not.

Miller']",https://doi.org/10.1145/800275.810947,"The occasion for this discussion is our recent experience with a severe shortfall in computational capacity at The Pennsylvania State University. Although the details of this affliction may not be reproduced elsewhere, it is our opinion that the events we experienced stem from essential, underlying phenomena which do have wide currency. These are, first, that overall demand for computational facilities and services is increasing ""exponentially"" and shows no sign of slowdown, and, second, that resources (most especially including funds) to provide increases in the relevant supply of computing capacities are not keeping pace and can not be expected to do so.It is possible that technical advances can treat this disorder, but in the nature of the political/bureaucratic systems which are the vehicles for the delivery of such ""fixes"", acquiring them will not be painless. Concretely, it seems unlikely that faculty and students in colleges and universities can expect relief from recurrent boom-and-bust in computational resources, whether the duration of such cycles is measured in decades or days. It behooves us to ask whether the attendant pains must be endured, and whether they are conducive to easier and more productive use of computing systems. Our answers are, first, that such pain does not ennoble, and, second, that it often is counterproductive. Consequently, we must try to identify the proximate sources of the disrupting effects of these cyclic shortfalls and attempt to curb them, within our means.We propose that the appropriate guidelines for allocating scarce computing resources may be characterized as prescriptions for humane rationing. In the most general terms, these prescriptions are 1) that qualified users should be ensured a fair share of the available resource without unnecessary expenses of effort in competition for them and in queuing, and 2) that use of computing resources should be so governed as to insure that all user sessions are as free as possible of delays, encumbrances, and constraints induced by management practices rather than by inherent limits of hard and software.While rationing is unnecessary during the occasional boom in academic computing resources, we should have on the shelf the management tools which can make fair and effective allocation possible during the recurrent busts we may anticipate in the 1980's.",0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

At the same time their data manipulation languages are usually limited and most data analysis applications require extensive programming in a host language. On the other hand, the packages of statistical subroutines (PSS) usually have very good data manipulation and analysis facilities, while at the same time they lack the well known advantages of DBMS. An attempt was made to combine the data definition and maintenance facilities of DBMS and the data manipulation and analysis facilities of PSS into a single user-oriented system. The additional software developed for this purpose performs the following functions:1. Allows the user to define his own analysis and (optionally) store it in a library for further reference.2. Allows the user to define the data on which analysis is to be performed.3. Allows the user to execute the (predefined) analysis in the following way:a. the user's description of analysis is translated into a sequence of data analysis and/or data manipulation subroutines of PSS.b. the required data are retrieved from a database under the control of DBMS and put into a temporary file, whose structure is determined by the analysis input requirements.c. the analysis is performed under the control of the executing program PSS.The outlined system is now being implemented, as an interdepartmental effort, in The Institute for Organization of the Medicine Industry, Warsaw, Poland. It utilizes IMS/VS as a database management system and the OSIRIS III package for statistical data processing. Although the system is still under development it is used not only by research workers but also by administrators and management for relatively simple analysis which are not routinely performed, standard reports.

32,Public use of an economic data base system. (Abstract Only),['Charles G. Renfro'],https://doi.org/10.1145/800275.810952,"The subject of this paper is the design of an economic data base system for public use, taking as a case study the Kentucky Economic Information System. This system offers its users facilities ranging from simple data retrieval and display to the capability to construct, maintain, and use econometric models online. It was designed originally to be user friendly to the trained econometrician, offering a semi-natural, verbal-mathematical free-format command language as the basic communication mechanism. However, with the development of the KEIS into a data base system that is widely used by government officials, academics, and others throughout Kentucky, the need has developed to provide a facility that is user friendly to any possible user. This paper considers the issue of user friendliness as a variable, depending upon the category of user. But it also considers tbe role played by the computer network and its operating conventions as a determinant of the user friendly features that are required. For example, in order to make the KEIS useable by reference librarians in universities, it was necessary to design a special interface; this necessity relates to the operating policies of the Kentucky Educational Computing Network, one of the computer networks the KEIS is resident upon. In addition, this paper considers the issue of user friendliness as it arises due to the specific characteristics of data and the operations performed: an economic data base system is inherently more difficult to operate than, say, a bibliographic data base system. Various other aspects of the KEIS have been considered in articles and papers appearing in such journals as the Journal of the American Society for Information Science and the Review of Public Data Use and in the proceedings of such conferences as the 1981 National Online Conference (March 1981) and the 8th European Urban Data Management Symposium, Oslo, Norway (June, 1981). A paper on the econometric modeling language (MODLER) that is available as part of the KEIS will be given at the 1981 Economic Control and Dynamics Conference, Copenhagen, Denmark (June 1981).

The following material was originally presented at the SIGSOC conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computing Systems.

It is difficult to compare the advantages and limitations of different approaches because they vary along many dimensions and because there is no commonly accepted terminology. A grouping of these dimensions into major categories is a necessary first step towards more empirical evaluations. The major software-related features of online assistance appear to fall into four categories:&bull; access method -- the way users can construct or enter requests for assistance;&bull; data structure -- the manner in which different portions of assistance information are related to each other;&bull; software architecture -- how assistance requests and their responses are communicated among a user, an operating system, application programs, and the assistance database; and&bull; contextual knowledge -- how much information is retained about the assistance environment, including the user, the application, and the tasks being performed.",8,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

The explanations are given through the COUSIN interface system which provides a cooperative tool-independent user interface for tools whose objects, operations, input syntax, display formats, etc. are declaratively represented in a tool description data base. The explanations are produced automatically from this data base, with no incremental effort on the part of the tool designer, and in a single uniform style for any tool that uses COUSIN as its interface. The explanation facility takes the form of a fine-grained, tightly linked network of text frames supported by the ZOG menu-selection system. Exactly what information the net building program, NB, extracts from a tool description, and the way in which this information is formatted in the text frames is controlled by a second declarative data base called the aspect description. The declarative nature of the aspect description makes it easy to adapt NB to changes in and extensions to the tool description formalism, and to experiment with the structure of the explanation network. We also describe how the appropriate network frame can be found and displayed in response to specific explanation requests from the user.",5,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

To save the expense of writing two documents covering the same material, it is not uncommon to find offline manuals that are available interactively as well as printed versions of material originally organized for online use. Because of the difficulties inherent in using the same material in different ways, neither approach is totally satisfactory. The THUMB system minimizes these problems by structuring offline documentation for interactive use. An expert on a particular text (e.g., its author) prepares a detailed representation of the organization of material within the document. Once this data structure (which resembles a thorough table of contents and heavily cross-referenced index) is available, users access information free from the strictures of linear text, simple indices, and page numbers. The expert's task is nontrivial, but it requires less effort than writing a new document. Creation and revision of text are made easy by supportive utilities. THUMB monitors reader's requests in order to provide experts with feedback about a document's use.

Computing in the Eighties will cause every university and college to evaluate and reconsider its exploitation of modern computing equipment for education and research.For example, at Northwestern University, it was recognized that continued growth in timesharing would be a major factor in computing at NU in the 1980s and that this growth would come from a large community of new users and of casual users. In January 1980, the Computing Center began a long-range planning study. A five-year equipment enhancement and replacement plan was to be developed which was intended to reverse an unsatisfactory trend toward computer saturation, to further improve and modernize our computer offerings, and to ensure that NU remained on a path of excellence in computing. Since time-sharing had already increased to over 50% of the total usage of the computer, a decision was made to begin the evaluation of modern timesharing systems, with special emphasis in two areas: 1) efficiency and reliability, and 2) the user interface.This paper describes the processes which were developed and used for the evaluation of the user interface, or as it came to be known, the ""friendliness"" study [1].",4,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

41,A statistical user interface for the Relational Model of data,['Robert F. Teitel'],https://doi.org/10.1145/800276.810961,"In the decade since the introduction of the Relational Model as a user view of large stored data bases, a variety of user languages have been proposed and a number of experimental systems have been implemented. The current computer science literature is replete with papers on the theoretical and practical aspects of the Relational Model and its implementation, as are most recent texts on data management systems.Implicit in the design of the user languages of most database systems, including those based on the Relational Model, are assumptions regarding the patterns of access to and the usage of the content of the database. Somewhat oversimplified, the assumed pattern of access is to search for a particular occurrence (case, observation) in the database which satisfies a given condition, and then to display the values of all attributes (fields, variables) of that one occurrence. The languages are designed to permit users to pose queries such as, for example, ""what widgets do we buy from ABC industries?"" or ""display Jones' employment history"". Queries of this type are termed informational queries; and systems supporting such queries with appropriate user languages and internal data storage techniques and access methods are information systems.A statistical query, similarly oversimplified, specifies a pattern of access to most, if not all, of the occurrences in a database, and a usage pattern of at most a few of the attributes. Examples of statistical queries are ""what is the average size of our purchase orders?"" and ""display the number of employees by race, sex, and job category"". Current statistical systems have limited capability for performing analysis over large and complex data collections, and their user languages reflects this limitation. A statistical query, as defined here, need not involve sophisticated mathematical analysis; the distinction between informational and statistical is derived from the antithetical patterns of access to and usage of the data content of a database. Most work on access languages for relationally based data systems has been on information query languages; very little work has been done on statistical query languages.This paper, then, discusses some elements of a language for statistical queries for a data system employing the Relational Model as the user view of large stored data bases.",1,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

It is assumed that the complete system - source code and data - already exists in a form which is as easily portable as possible between different computer environments. For such systems adaptability is the problem of adjusting the user interface and analytic capabilities to suit different user communities when such a system is transferred from one environment to another. This may include adaptation to specific hardware facilities as well as user requirements.In 1977/8 the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) funded a project at University College Cardiff to implement a portable computing software system originating from the Population Dynamics Group (PDG) at the University of Illinois. This system allowed users to perform population projections under different demographic conditions showing in a graphical presentation how the population of a country varies over selected time spans. The database consisted of population statistics for a number of countries. When implemented at Cardiff it was intended that this system should be used as a demographic training aid by the post graduate diploma students in the David Owen Centre for Population Growth Studies. These students are an international group who are specialists in the field of demography but have little or no computing background.This paper will discuss briefly how this portable system was implemented on a PDP 11 minicomputer at Cardiff and then give a fuller description of the adaptation of the user interface and analytic capabilities to the local community and its computer facilities.

Cichelli's hash function is machine-independent because the character code used by a particular machine never enters into the hash calculation.Cichelli's algorithm uses a simple backtracking process to find an assignment of non-negative integers to letters which results in a perfect minimal hash function. Cichelli employs a twofold ordering strategy which rearranges the static set of keys in such a way that hash value collisions will occur and be resolved as early as possible during the backtracking process. This double ordering provides a necessary reduction in the size of the potentially large search space, thus considerably speeding the computation of associated values.In spite of Cichelli's ordering strategies, his method is found to require excessive computation to find hash functions for sets of keys with more than about 40 members. Cichelli's method is also limited since two keys with the same first and last letters and the same length are not permitted.Alternative algorithms and their implementations will be discussed in the next section; these algorithms overcome some of the difficulties encountered when using Cichelli's original algorithm. Some experimental results are presented, followed by a discussion of the application of perfect hash functions to the problem of natural language lexicon design.",0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

46,Designing SENSE (a software environment for social science rEsearch): The role of software tools,"['N. J. Fiddian', 'W. A. Gray', 'M. W. Read']",https://doi.org/10.1145/800276.810966,"In most general purpose computer systems there is a wide variety
of software available to users. Such software is usually provided
in one of three organisational forms - routines in a library;
collections of related functions grouped in a package with a common
interface; independent programs called through operating system
commands. This interdependent tripartite structure creates problems
for non-sophisticated users as it involves different levels of user
interface complexity.At the routine level a user must write
programs in an appropriate host programming language to use the
software. If he wishes to use a selection of routines written in
incompatible languages then he may have to familiarise himself with
more than one host language. In each language he must be aware of
the calling conventions for routines, the possible representations
of various types of data, the methods of passing parameters and the
ways of inputting and outputting data to and from the external
environment. This type of interface occurs with libraries like NAG
and IMSL.In the case of packages the imperative user interface is usually
somewhat simpler, consisting essentially of a name identifying the
function required and some associated parameters which identify
variables, labels, files, options, control and code values, etc as
appropriate. However, function calls of this form must normally be
preceded by a non-trivial amount of declarative and other ""red
tape"" information expressed in the package interface language.
Also, package environments can be restrictive in that the user is
constrained to the types of data structure and analysis supported
by the chosen package unless he is prepared to write programs to
transform his data for other packages or to analyse it
independently. SPSS is typical of this kind of package.When software facilities are provided at the program level, the
user interface often consists simply of one-line program invocation
commands written in the local operating system's command language,
with program options and data files identified by command
parameters. Common examples of such facilities are sort and
archiving programs. A program level interface becomes even simpler,
and at the same time more powerful, if command sequences can be
formed into parameterised command procedures and if programs are
enabled to conmlunicate directly with one another without the need
for explicit intermediate files.In the latter type of environment the application software user
generally finds that there are analytic program tools available to
meet only some of his requirements. Consequently he has to embrace
either or both of the other levels in addition in order to increase
the analytic power available to him. Transfer between levels is not
easily accomplished in most systems as facilities do not normally
exist to help the user move data between levels. This difficulty
comes on top of the obvious problem of having to master more than
one interface and more than one level of complexity.In the SENSE project (11), which is funded by the U.K. Social
Science Research Council, we are creating a prototype computing
environment for social science researchers which can accommodate
non-sophisticated users. The aim is to provide an integrated
environment where such users will have a complete range of
application software available (packages, routines and programs)
through a single, simple user interface. We believe that this can
be achieved by exploiting and extending the concept of software
tools propounded by Kernighan and Plauger (19), so that as far as
possible all software can be used through a program level
interface, with its attendant advantages. Following Kernighan and
Plauger we believe that software tools ""can be used to create a
comfortable and effective interface to existing programs"", as well
as providing an ideal model for the structuring of brand new
application software. This paper will consider various aspects of
the initial design of the SENSE software environment with
particular reference to the importance of software tools in that
design.",0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

51,The mini-micro connection,['G. R. Boynton'],https://doi.org/10.1145/800276.810971,"The office of the future is defined. It is a work station
dominated by a micro computer which is in communication with more
powerful computers, large disks, printers, and other equipment
which can be shared. The large computers, disks, printers, and all
the rest already exist. Micro Computers or desk top computers
already exist. There are only two steps left in realizing the
office of the future. One step involves electronics; establishing
high speed communication between the desk top computer and all of
the other equipment. The second involves programming; defining and
developing coherent software systems. This paper is about the way
in which these two problems were handled by the department of
political science at the university of Iowa.Weeg Computing Center provides academic computing services for
the University of Iowa. They do this with a collection of
computers; there is an I.B.M. 370, 5 Prime 750s, 4 Hewlett Packard
2000s, and a Vax. There are also disks, plotters, printers, and the
whole panoply of equipment one expects in a university computing
environment. In addition, a Gandalf communication system makes it
possible to access any one of these computers at speeds up to 2400
bits per second. These facilities are normally accessed with the
aid of one of the approximately 750 terminals on campus. With the
support of Weeg computing Center the department of political
science convinced the university administration that it would be
worthwhile experimenting with desk top computers for an entire
department. Money was made available, and 37 computers were
purchased. Which brought us to the two problems: high speed (in
this case 2400 bits per second) communication; and a coherent
system of programs.Commodore 8032s were purchased, and this meant that we needed an
interface which would translate into the serial signal the Gandalf
system used. Several interfaces were available commercially, but we
could not make any of them work at 2400 bits per second. Nor could
we get the terminal emulator programs available commercially to
print the screen at 2400 bits per second. The dominant speed in
micro to larger computer communication is 300 b.p.s., fast means
1200 bits per second. An interface board was designed by the
electronics shop at the University for us, and a machine language
program was written which would handle sending and receiving at the
requisite speed. In principle this seemed a straightforward task.
In practice there was a stream of nitty gritty problems that seemed
as though it would go on forever. But it was done.Three design considerations dominated the creation of the
software system. One, it had to be as simple to use as possible.
Half of the potential users had never used a computer before. That
implied that the system must be as automatic as possible. Two, it
had to, initially, provide a terminal to each user plus handle word
processing and electronic mail for the department. Three, it had to
allocate tasks between the desk top computers and the Weeg supplied
computers in a way that, within reasonable bounds, maximized the
work done on the desk top computers and minimized use of central
resources.Two features of the system illustrate our attempt to make it as
easy to use as possible. First, signing on to the central computer
is almost automatic. Each person's copy of the machine language
program contains their four codes required to sign on to the
system. The individual can send these codes by pressing the control
key and the up arrow or programs developed for this system will
automatically send these codes. Signing off is equally automatic.
When the Prime on the other end has finished sending or receiving a
program or data it automatically signs off. Second, all choices are
made from two lists. One list is on the Prime, and the other list
is embedded in the software used on the CBM 8032. Physical
contiguity of choices reduces the amount of recall necessary to use
the system.A good screen based text editing program enhances one's ability
to put words together. It does this by making it easy to write and
revise. However, there are many tasks, in addition to writing and
revising, that one needs to be able to carry out with the document
being written. You must be able to save and recall the text. It is
very nice to be able to append a second file to the one being
written. It is very nice to be able to save a segment of the file
being written. And the text must be sent to be printed. All of
these operations can be performed with the aid of the list of
commands in the text editing program. One presses 's' and gives a
file name; the programs do the rest. In addition, one would like to
be able to look at a list of files that have been created and
saved, delete files that are no longer needed, transfer a file to
the disk storage area of a collaborator for his or her review, send
a file (program or program control information) to the batch
processing system, and send a file directly from the disk to be
printed. All of these tasks can be performed using the list of
commands on the Prime. Most of the operations one can imagine
wanting to perform on a text file can be accomplished with one of
the two lists. That makes the system easy to learn; it provides
coherence.In this system the Prime serves as the storage device and the
medium of communication. Programs and text files are stored on the
Prime disk; there are no disks for the desk top computers. In
addition, sending a file to be printed or sending a file to a
collaborator plus electronic mail are handled by the Prime. The
desk top computers handle the writing and revising which is done
with a program written in BASIC to run on these computers. Since
writing is an exceedingly important part of the job of academics
the computers are on all the time. But most of the time they are
not on to the central computing resources; they are working as
stand alone computers.When you walk up and down the hall in the department of
political science you see lots of computers going. Writing has
become much easier. And getting a final document produced has never
been as easy or as fast. The mini-micro connection works.",0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

53,Interfacing to text using HELPME,"['Thomas P. Kehler', 'Mike Barnes']",https://doi.org/10.1145/800276.810973,"HELPME is a Lisp based system designed to provide on-line help for novice and expert users of computer systems. HELPME permits the implementation of easy to use interfaces to existing documents by allowing a user familiar with a document (a 'document expert') to produce an index and incorporate information relating to the structure of the document into the interface. A typical user of HELPME can then interact with the document and index through a series of commands to quickly find the information desired.The primary advantage of a system like HELPME is that it permits construction of interfaces to existing on-line documents and provides three modes of interaction with the documents: simple display, indexed-based query and context overview. Simple display permits forward and reverse movement through a document while index-based query uses key-words to select relevant sections of the document hierarchy for display. Context overview permits a hierarchical view of the document. For example, the table of contents of a document can be used to construct this hierarchy. Each of these modes of interaction are independent and may be selected by the user at any point. The goal of HELPME is to allow a user to find any information in a document relating to the user's requests. Of course, many users do not have a good grasp on exactly what they are looking for but rely on inadvertent discovery. It is hoped that the flexibility of a HELPME-like system will satisfy the goals of an easy-to-use, extensible help system for computing environments.

Gadol']",https://doi.org/10.1145/800276.810975,"The complexity of information processing, disseminating and controlling is very high within a sizable corporation. Database design, targeted to carry out these functions, is constantly improving. Nevertheless, nonprogrammers have trouble accessing most databases. Layers of EDP personnel, as well as unresponsive and cumbersome systems, are an obstacle to effective database use.In this paper, we describe an exploratory investigation of databases based on REL ENGLISH [1]. In our system, data structures and access language were designed to map closely the corporate structure and its terminology. Our test vehicle was a portion of Hewlett-Packard's internal information network, the corporate Order Processing System. We have identified about a dozen job related perspectives belonging to geographically dispersed and functionally stratified end-users within various entities of the HP organization. A multinested data model is an intertwined hierarchy: the join of separate hierarchies with different lexicons but shared data events. For our test, we have selected two major intersecting multinested user views: sales and manufacturing. Our design accommodates users with differing perspectives of this model.The system data structures were constructed using the REL ENGLISH primitives. The Condensed Order Records (COR) base spanned a multinested hierarchy four levels deep for the Sales Organization taxonomy and five levels deep for the Manufactured Products taxomony. The design permits the user to query the COR base about the data model itself. He can, of course, also obtain the standard statistical views of the data.Corporate taxonomies are dynamically changing structures. The database model needs to reflect this change. In most cases, the user wants to manipulate data at three levels in his own job taxonomy and at all levels in the other taxonomies. The multinested data model is needed in order to permit the user to view the data from the same perspective that he views his job in the corporate organization.",4,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

This report presents early results of a study conducted to ascertain the written analogues of the programming structures iteration, conditional and variables. The study required users already familiar with office procedures to practice a routine forms fill-in and data verification task over a period of one week. At the end of that time, they were required to write a set of procedures as if they were instructing a new person in the performance of the job. These written protocols (in conjunction with verbal protocols taken during the learning phase) were analyzed in terms of the above-mentioned structures.It was found that a variety of structures are used by naive users, but more importantly, all users made serious errors of both omission and commission. In particular, events of low probability were not described at all. In certain cases the written instructions did not correspond with the way in which users actually performed the tasks.The implications for office systems designers, amongst others, are explored.",0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

58,The coming world of “what you see is what you get” (abstract only),['Don Hatfield'],https://doi.org/10.1145/800276.810978,"The term 'what you see is what you get' has been used to refer to the editing of fully formatted documents so that every edit change causes the text to be updated immediately to show the document as it would appear when printed, thus eliminating the immediate step of (periodically) invoking a formatter explicitly. This mode of working is generally agreed to result in more and better results with less effort, both because the real-world simulation of a document is easier to use than a mixture of format command statements and unformatted text, and because many errors show up more immediately in a real-world situation than in a complicated abstraction.What happens if we extend this notion throughout the interface between the user and the computer? We enter a world of constrained objects and functional (applicative) actions. If the constraints are algebraic, the result is VISICALC-Iike. If the constraints are formats, the result is format programs which are also (unfilled) documents and can be created and edited as document images. If the constraints are actions themselves, the result is islands of action-programs in a sea of constraints.We propose, as the user interface, a general constraints language for documents. The documents are also ""templates"" or ""forms"", and have a robustness that makes them hard to injure. Anything may be represented as a document, from a memo to a database to a protein molecule. The commands for applying constraints all take no arguments other than the thing the user is pointing at when the command is given. The user's world is then like a large Tinkertoy environment, for constructing active and passive things.Examples of working in this world, in black and white and in color, will be given covering traditional text operations, the construction and use of document templates, the equivalent of programming as we know it, the equivalent of programming as we don't know it, and finally a John Milton template to test the relation between Paradise Lost and the fundamental theorem of the calculus.",2,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

60,Design issues for online documentation systems (abstract only),['Carolyn P. Steinhaus'],https://doi.org/10.1145/800276.810980,The design of an effective interactive documentation system is introduced by tracing a hypothetical development effort aimed at shifting information contained in printed volumes of documentation to a form suitable for interactive access. Taking this approach presents a view of online documentation systems as the result of the process of adapting information conveyed in printed volumes to the constraint of interactive software considered as an information medium. The resulting discussion necessarily involves consideration of the demands which interactive software makes on both the organization of information about interactive programs and on the cognitive capacities of people using it.Existing documentation is typically intended to serve all of the informational needs of any person who uses an interactive software system. The requirements of software systems for structure and precision demand a more detailed understanding than currently exists of exactly how to provide information to people of varying levels of experience with a particular program or with computing in general. The interaction between the purposes of existing documentation and the requirements of an online system provide an interesting context for discussion of the major issues facing the designer of an interactive documentation system.,0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

Using the ability of the University of Calgary's Honeywell Multics Operating System to tailor a command and response environment, a subset of commands and responses (called GENIE) was set up in a user-friendly environment to facilitate novice students programming at CRT terminals. Frequency and time of usage of all commands was metered and changing patterns of usage emerged as the semester progressed. For example, ""help"" usage -- which was originally quite extensive and broad -- limited itself over time to questions only about specific topics. Reluctance to use an ""audit"" facility to capture an interactive session disappeared as the commands for such usage were likened to a movie camera taking pictures over a student's shoulder. It is further noted that specific emphasis was placed on simplifying commands and reducing options.The whole idea of a restricted command environment is compared to the ""abstract machine"" concept of Hopper, Kugler, and Unger who are building a universal command and response language (NICOLA, a NIce Standard COmmand LAnguage). GENIE is seen as an example of what such an abstract machine could be if the Multics operating system were viewed as a basic or ""parent"" abstract machine.

Engineers and scientists are not typically computer professionals; they intimately understand the application at hand and do not want to he bogged down either with computerese and 25 manuals which might contain a desired answer, or with explaining enough of the problem to a computer professional to have the program written by someone else. Ideally, the problem solution should come from the engineer or scientist when viewed from an efficiency perspective. In such application areas, price/performance is no longer the primary factor in selecting computing equipment; ease of adaptability and availability/accessibility are becoming more important criteria when identifying a computer which can provide effective man/machine synergy.The HP 9845 Computing System has the HP IMAGE DBM System capability available as a tool for its users. To help non-computer people to design data bases (the most difficult and frightening part of using data base), we have created a data base design kit manual. This manual will guide a user, through either an intuitive or a rigorous design technique, from problem definition to a working data base diagram. From this diagram, the user is ready to define, create, and use the data base. For this, we have developed a general purpose data base management program, called QUERY/45. QUERY/45 can define and create data bases, and also provides updating facilities including adding, modifying, and deleting information with or without user-defined forms. All of the helps and teaching tools will enable engineers and scientists to use a data base without having to write any programs.

In the past, most of the attention in discussions of Ease of Use has focused on Ease of Learning. This is the motivation behind consideration for the ""naive"" or ""casual"" user. The most common approach has been to allow trading computing functionality for Ease of Learning. This makes the most commonly performed tasks very simple to perform, but prevents a wide range of other tasks from being performed at all. This affects Ease of Doing.Ease of Doing is a concept that has been primarily associated with expert users of computing systems. A task is only Easy to Do on a computer if the proper tools have been provided for doing it. Since there is an enormous range of tasks to apply systems to, there must also be a large collection of tools. A great variety of software tools that are finely tuned to particular applications should be made available to users.

Because we have not had a language for describing the user orientation of computer systems, a variety of interpersonal metaphors have been used to aid in the comparative evaluations of systems. Recent cultural history has shaped the semantics of computer systems. Out of the turbulent, liberal strains of the 1960s emerged the movement to humanize computer systems. During the self-centered backlash of the 1970s the term friendly became a computer household word. During the 1980s we need to grow beyond a concern for friendliness alone and build systems that are considerate.Consideration supercedes friendliness in at least three major ways, First, it goes beyond satisfaction by focusing upon attempts to help and assist others. Secondly, it requires that a person take the role of another and take the other's needs into account. Thirdly, to be considerate is to be courteous and, most importantly, respectful. In these respects, the metaphor of the considerate system points to the essence of user orientation wltbout sacrificing other critical system features such as productivity. In fact, truly considerate systems will facilitate productivity because of improved communication clarity, greater tolerance for user errors and idiosyncrasies, and increased availability of options, i.e., user-directed socio-computer interaction.Designing and developing considerate systems is not easy and requires considerable time and effort. Representative users must he involved in the selection of system features and in the process (formative) evaluation as well as the outcome (summative) evaluation.

This paper suggests that an enhanced text editor can serve as the interactive interface for most purposes. For example, consider the file directory instead of choosing among half a dozen or more system commands to view and modify it, the user can edit an image that represents the directory. Deletion, renaming, and movement to another directory are easily accomplished with ordinary editor commands. Other system commands can he supplanted by a mechanism of ""creation sequences"" for files. Rather than execute the creation sequence, the user simply asks to view the file resulting from it.To facilitate this form of interaction, the text editor must include some novel features. It must permit structured files; where the structure can be a field structure within records or a hierarchical structure between records.

74,The CONFER experience of the Merit Computer Network (abstract only),['Christine Wendt'],https://doi.org/10.1145/800276.810994,"CONFER emerged from a concern with small group governance in
both its communications and decision making dimensions. This
context will be described as well as the principles operationalized
in the CONFER system: individual equality, freedom, privacy and
flexibility, and the facilitation of individual participation.
CONFER is based on the proposition that effective communication is
an active process for all concerned. This activity is strongly
encouraged in CONFER through a number of mechanisms designed to
facilitate interaction between the user and the CONFER system, as
well as interaction among all the users of the system. As well,
growth of the system over time is promoted by interaction of the
system designer with the user community.The development of Merit's use of CONFER was aided greatly by
our continuing close relationship with Dr. Parnes and by the
participation of many members of the Merit staff in the CONFERence
for CONFER development that he eventually began. As we identified
new aspects of CONFER use, we usually also were able to think of
changes to CONFER that would facilitate them. For example, as we
began to realize how important was the general conversation among
our users--a critical need for the isolated user in particular--we
led the lobbying effort for changes to make the voting structure
more interactive. In response, CONFER over the years has radically
altered the default form of participant comments from its original
formal and anonymous style to a conversational model. Similarly, as
CAUCUS grew to enormous size we asked for (and got) aids in
managing, and then in re-starting, large Conferences. In a
remarkably short time, CAUCUS became a general meeting place for
many who were not Merit users at all, simply because it offered a
place for users to meet one another and share problems and
solutions. Eventually CAUCUS gave birth to a general-purpose
CONFERence for users of one of the host systems--an idea that has
since been implemented elsewhere as well.The growing use of CAUCUS as a communications medium for Merit
staff eventually resulted in the birth of a CONFERence for that
specific purpose. Before the use of CONFER there had been
relatively little communication between the staff members at the
central site and those located at the host computing centers except
for occasional face-to-face meetings that were largely reportorial
in content. Once CAUCUS showed the staff that network issues could
be discussed in real time and that input from the host staffs could
have weight, the pattern of decision-making began to change. With
the inception of the MNET:STAFF CONFERence, and the resulting

direct contact with any MTS site (the CONFER host computer system).
In many cases, the main contact of the CONFER user is with the
third party vendor or consultant who is supporting the networking
effort. Several problems arise when the third party relationship is
not broadened to include the institutional consulting and
documentation efforts. Such problems include:1. Overload on the
time of the third-party consultant.2. Production of custom
documentation which parallels the institutional documentation.3.
User perceptions that they are not ""ready"" for institutional
documentation.4. Development of abbreviated cognitive maps of the
system and its user network.5. Users exchange superstitious views
of how the system works.While it is not yet clear that the
absorption of third-party, mediated networks will solve such
problems, it is an obvious first step to a solution.MTS Help FacilityA version of CONFER is tentatively planned for use as the
principal Help Facility at WSU. A subset of CONFER capabilities
will be employed to decrease demands on the system.Features of the Help Facility will include agenda string
searches, execution of computer assisted instruction lessons from
within tbe CONFERence, a ""suggestion box"" facility, and user
modelling features intended to decrease user frustration and
maximize efficiency. Existing help files will be called from the
Help Facility to increase the redundancy of available help to the
user.The agenda used will be multi-dimensional, allowing the user to
search for help within subject areas, type of information and skill
level. For example, the user would be able to view all items which
serve as tutorials on statistical packages with the CONFER command:
AGENDA TUTORIALS+STATISTICS. Similarly, the user will be able to
search item descriptors or text for character strings, such as
using WHICH ""SPSS"" to locate all items dealing with SPSS.Requests for help will be sent directly to various CSC
departments, and responded to either via CONFER or telephone. User
suggestions and requests will be screened on a continuing basis by
CSC staff, and changes to the information contained in each item
will be made as a result of these suggestions. Materials developed
by users will be solicited for inclusion in the Help Facility.",0,May 1981  ,Article ,CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems.

81,Evaluating the suggestiveness of command names,['Jarrett Rosenberg'],https://doi.org/10.1145/800049.801746,"An important feature of the design of human-computer interfaces is that of command languages: the vocabulary and syntax that allow a user to express commands to the system. If we look at command languages from the standpoint of natural languages, rather than formal ones, then there are three aspects to their user interface. The first is the overall structure of the user-system dialogue—its pragmatics, so to speak (e.g., [3]), which includes issues of contextual reference, presuppositions, and so on. The second aspect of command languages is their syntax (e.g., [1], [4]). The important issue here is the trade-off between consistency of the syntax and its similarity to that of natural language. The third aspect of command languages is their semantics, primarily that of their commands. Most command languages are fairly small, with simple data and control structures, and so their semantics are fairly trivial. More important is the “lexical” semantics of commands and their arguments and parameters. The crucial factor here is the names given to the entities and operations in the system by the command language: if those names are not apt, performance will be impaired just as with poorly designed syntax or dialogue structure. This paper investigates the psycholinguistic aspects of this naming problem.",2,March 1982  ,Article ,CHI '82: Proceedings of the 1982 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction paradigms', 'Software and its engineering', 'Software notations and tools', 'Context specific languages', 'Command and control languages']"

The study presented here focuses on very simple languages, without embedded features and where each computer command label corresponds to only one function. Three different approaches have been taken in order to improve the design of such simple languages: evaluation of existing languages (Scapin [1]); study of experimental languages that differ on linguistic or semantic variables (Hammond et al.

Jones']",https://doi.org/10.1145/800049.801750,"The last half decade has witnessed a rapidly accelerating trend toward the application of video display terminal (VDT) technology for information management in the office workplace, and a growing body of scientific and anecdotal data on the implications of VDT use for the well-being of office workers [2,4,6-8,11,15,16]. A striking aspect of the research on this subject is the degree of conflict among reports regarding the type, magnitude, and causes of adverse changes in the health, comfort, and satisfaction of the VDT user, as is apparent in a recent review by Dainoff [5].Methodological limitations of much of the work to date probably account for some of these inconsistencies. Many of the studies are demonstrations, or pre-experimental or field investigations with control or statistical measures which allow at best, only general and limited inferences regarding the effects of VDT work [4,8,11,16]. A more serious limitation involves the conceptualization or operational definition of VDT use which in turn determines the elements or factors which eventually figure into a VDT stress model or study design. As an operation or job demand, VDT use is clearly not a unidimensional phenomenon. Based upon findings in an investigation of health complaints and job stress surrounding VDT use in newspaper and insurance facilities, Smith, et al. [16] demonstrated that VDTs may present a wide range of organizational as well as physical or environmental job challenges. To date, numerous investigations have focused mainly on the physical ergonomic demands associated with VDT use [7]. A few have placed strong emphasis on job content, psychosocial, and related operational-organizational factors [8,11,16]. None have systematically examined the unique and integrated effects of these two sets of potential stressors. Smith, et al.

Not only have computers changed quite dramatically since 1963, they have also become increasingly common. It would seem likely then that attitudes towards computers have also changed and hence need to be re-evaluated in the present decade.In this study, the attitudes of certified public accountants (CPAs), lawyers, pharmacists, and physicians were investigated.

A primary reason for this lack of information is the practical difficulty of experimentation. Many of these features are time-consuming to implement, are usually implemented without adequate instrumentation, and are implemented in different and difficult to compare ways from system to system (see [10], for example).

One way to circumvent these problems is to provide general assistance to the decision maker that is independent of any particular decision situation.

A computable measure of readability would therefore be useful to program developers during coding and to those assuming responsibility for maintenance of software developed elsewhere. In a series of Algol 68 programs, analyzer generated (machine-computable) and human-judged program factors were examined. The first two present authors found that program length and reasonable practice concerning identifier length were excellent predictors of judgments of readability. These predictors were chosen from a large set of analyzer-generated predictors including software science measures as defined by Halstead and several others; the analyzer-generated predictors were found to replicably estimate a high proportion (41 percent) of variance in readability in new readability judgments.While an estimate of readability based only on analyzer-generated predictors would be clearly useful, human ratings (such as quality of comments, logicality of control flow, and meaningfulness of identifier names) were examined to determine whether they could add significantly to the quality of estimates of readability.

It has long been recognized that one of the most essential elements of any successful model of this process is a quantification of the complexity of software systems. During the past several years a great deal of work has been performed by researchers such as Halstead [3], McCab [5], and others in an attempt to develop metrics which adequately capture the complexity of software systems. Yet one very important aspect of software development complexity seems to have been overlooked in the rush to develop software complexity metrics, q.e. it's psychological nature.A basic tenet of our research is that the effort to develop a software system is a function of it's 'perceived' complexity; which in turn is dependent upon both the physical nature of the software system being developed and the psychological nature of the individual(s) performing the development. The immediate goal of the research reported on in this paper was to examine this dual dependency. In order to do so we collected data from two sections (same instructor) of a college sophomore - level class on PL/I which consisted of fifty-six students.

Recent work in the author's laboratory indicates a strong preference for error-correcting over error-preventing strategies on the part of human problem-solvers. Unfortunately, most contemporary computer languages and programming environments enforce an error-preventing rather than error-correcting strategy. Using Marvin Minsky's concept of a frame, an error-correcting programming strategy may be thought of as obtaining a program frame with all parameters pre-set to their default values, and then revising those values until a script corresponding to a successful solution is arrived at. The present paper defines a frame-based programming environment which can accommodate error-correcting programming strategies, and discusses the application of such environments to different types of programming languages.",1,March 1982  ,Article ,CHI '82: Proceedings of the 1982 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Control methods', 'Philosophical/theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence', 'Cognitive science', 'Search methodologies', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Empirical studies in HCI', 'Theory of computation', 'Design and analysis of algorithms', 'Algorithm design techniques', 'Dynamic programming']"

Instead, the interface must become easier to use so that more people can take advantage of the richer function. In the small business environment, in particular, it is crucial that new systems be usable by a customer's current staff and not require the addition of new and sophisticated data processing expertise. Personnel costs already comprise 45-50% of most data processing budgets (1).Much of the ease-of-use of smaller systems has been due to their limited function. The user has been able to learn to use the system interfaces because each interface involved only a few functions and the interfaces were few in number. Conversely, very large and complex systems have traditionally been programmed and managed by high powered, highly trained staffs with the resources and the sophistication to cope with complex challenges. Here too, however, the high cost and the limited availability of such people increase the need for ease-of-use breakthroughs(5).",1,March 1982  ,Article ,CHI '82: Proceedings of the 1982 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computer systems organization', 'Architectures', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Social and professional topics', 'Professional topics', 'Management of computing and information systems', 'Project and people management', 'Systems analysis and design']"

The backbone of this “Information Revolution” is the computer. As a result we find that the computer, so far restricted in the backstage of a secluded computer room, expands rapidly onto every work-station in the plant and the office environment. This expansion presents a serious concern to many sociologists, psychologists, environmentalists, computer scientists, designers, architects and industrial engineers.Our concern emanates from the possible effects that this new intruder to the work environment will have on its human operators. An inkling of these effects is presented to us today when we visit a data center: wide open areas with huge display tubes planted like in a grove, is the first thing we see; behind them are the people working with them. They are slouching in front of a keyboard which is located on a standard height desk, and they are staring at a display tube through the hazy reflections of the ceiling lights and their own face. They are hiding from each other with the help of three-foot high piles of computer printouts located on their desk, on a chair, on the floor, in the waste paper basket. They are talking to the terminal, sometimes lovingly, sometimes cursingly. They are talking to each other with a confusing jargon.

155,Manual dexterity-a user-oriented approach to creating computer documentation.,['Patricia Wright'],https://doi.org/10.1145/800045.801572,"This paper will not advocate list of firm recommendations about document design because it is recognised that design decisions will vary with many factors. Instead, the present discussion will emphasize that when making these decisions it is necessary for designers to take account of how readers will use the information provided. In order to help them do this, a simple framework is proposed which outlines the rudiments of how people interact with technical documents.The advantages of this framework will be illustrated by using it to motivate design decisions at two decision levels. At a “macro” level the document designer must make broad decisions about the contents and format of the manual. At a “micro” level the designer must select particular combinations of linguistic, graphic and typographic options which will help readers locate, understand and implement the information given in the manual.",18,December 1983  ,Article ,CHI '83: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Applied computing', 'Document management and text processing', 'Document preparation', 'Computing methodologies', 'Machine learning', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)']"

Machines are special-purpose, have forms suggestive of their functions, are operated with controls in obvious one-to-one correspondence with their actions, and the consequences of the actions on visible objects are immediately and readily apparent. By contrast, computer systems are general-purpose, have inscrutable form, are operated symbolically via a keyboard with no obvious correspondence between keys and actions, and typically operate on invisible objects with consequences that are not immediately or readily apparent. The characteristics possessed by machines, but typically absent in computer systems, aid learning, use and transfer among machines. But “hard,” physical machines have limitations: they are inflexible, and their complexity can overwhelm us. We have built in our laboratory “soft machine” interfaces for computer systems to capitalize on the good characteristics of machines and overcome their limitations. A soft machine is implemented using the synergistic combination of real-time computer graphics to display “soft controls,” and a touch screen to make soft controls operable like conventional hard controls.",31,December 1983  ,Article ,CHI '83: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction devices', 'Touch screens']"

The software was repeatedly revised to recognize users' new commands; in essence, the users defined the interface. This procedure was used on 67 subjects. The first version of the software could recognize only 7% of all the subjects' spontaneously generated commands; the final version could recognize 76% of those commands.

An interpreter that executes the resulting specification is then described. Some problems that arise in specifying a user interface are addressed by particular features of the technique: To reduce the complexity of the developer's task, a user interface is divided into the semantic, syntactic, and lexical levels, and a separate executable specification is provided for each. A process of stepwise refinement of the syntactic specification, leading from an informal specification to an executable one is also presented.

160,Design practice and interface usability: Evidence from interviews with designers,"['N. Hammond', 'A. Jørgensen', 'A. MacLean', 'P. Barnard', 'J. Long']",https://doi.org/10.1145/800045.801577,"Research into human-computer interaction (HCI) is mainly conducted by engineering psychologists, cognitive psychologists and computer scientists. The principal consumers of applied HCI research, on the other hand, are human factors practitioners and system designers and developers. The HCI researcher who believes his or her findings to be of practical relevance has therefore to consider the interface between researcher and practitioner as well as that between system and user: the products of HCI research must not only be relevant but also “user-friendly” to the practitioner. This problem is not merely one of communication between different professional communities, as the optimal route for the translation of research findings into terms that will be of practical use in the design process is itself a matter of considerable uncertainty and debate. Thus there are many instances in the research literature where apparently contradictory recommendations can all too easily be drawn from findings based on sound but, by its very nature, limited experimentation (e.g., compare the findings of Landauer et al., in press, Ledgard et al., 1980, and Scapin, 1981, on naming text-editing operations).One of the prerequisites for tackling both the communication problem and the translation problem is an understanding of relevant aspects of decision-making in design which influence the usability of the end-user interface. This is so for three reasons. First, an appreciation of the nature of design practice will at least help identify those areas where research input might have the greatest impact and allow researchers to direct their efforts towards them. Second, it may identify possible modifications to existing design practice which would allow research input to be used more effectively. Finally, it would be somewhat surprising if current design practice were not to furnish researchers with any insights into the underlying processes of users. The experience and skills of the practitioner should be a valuable source of information for the HCI researcher. For these reasons, we have been documenting some of the relationships between design practice and the usability of systems for use by non-experts. While there is considerable literature on programming behaviour (e.g. Mayer, 1981), reports of design behaviour are rare, other than occasional descriptions by practitioners of the interface design of their own products (e.g., Botterill, 1982; Smith et al., 1982). This paper focusses on the influence of the individual designer's decision-making. Evidence is taken from interviews with experienced system designers concerning design issues influencing the nature of the user interface which had arisen with systems they had recently worked on. For two of the systems usability investigations had been performed (see Lewis & Mack, 1982 and Hammond et al., 1983).",39,December 1983  ,Article ,CHI '83: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction paradigms', 'Natural language interfaces']"

An example analysis of several text editing systems is presented, and various properties of the systems are derived from the analysis.

In this note we present theoretical considerations and empirical data relevant to attaining these goals. First, we mention four principles for system design which we believe are necessary to attain these goals; Then we present survey results that demonstrate that our principles are not really all that obvious, but just seem obvious once presented. The responses of designers suggest they may sometimes think they are doing what we recommend when in fact they are not. This is consistent with the experience that systems designers do not often recommend or use them themselves. We contrast some of these responses with what we have in mind in order to provide a more useful description of our principles. Lastly, we consider why this might be so. These sections are summaries of those in a longer paper to appear elsewhere (Gould & Lewis, 1983).

Many papers have been written describing the bad effects of computer response times that are too long or too short, and many sets of “guidelines” for appropriate human-engineered computer response times in human-machine systems have been published, as well. Nearly all these sets of guidelines are direct descendants of the set published by Robert Miller (1968) about 15 years ago. When Miller wrote his guidelines, he was quite open in describing them as based only on his experience, and he called for experimental data that would allow for the formulation of better, empirically-based rules for setting computer response time for optimal human performance.About fifteen years later, these studies are still missing, for the most part. Aside for the problem-solving studies of Grossberg, et al. (1976), Goodman and Spence (1981), Bergrnan, et al.

One system is message-oriented, requiring a conferee to complete a message before interacting with others. The other displays what each group member is typing in a separate window on the screens of all participants. In this system, comments can be made as ideas are expressed. Groups were asked to solve a problem first individually and then cooperatively using one of the two systems. All groups produced decisions superior to the average initial individual solutions. Window system groups both improved more and produced significantly higher quality decisions. These groups focused on fewer topics at one time while spending less time discussing how to organize both system and task efforts.

The representation system is especially valuable as a design tool when used in a simulation of a proposed user interface.In order to characterize the interaction between a user and a system, an explicit and formal representation of the behavior of the system itself is needed. To be of value in the design of user interfaces, the representation should be independent of the actual implementation of the system, but also reflect the structural properties of the system's behavior, such as its hierarchical form, the possible modes, and the consistent patterns of interaction.

Systems of interest (like home information systems) often consist of new and frequently changing content in large and varied domains, and are particularly prone to these problems. We explored several ways in which one might name categories in one such domain (Yellow Page category headings) - category names, category names plus examples, and examples alone. We found that three examples alone were essentially as good a way to name these categories as either an expertly chosen name or a name plus examples.

The Hybrid display is created by opening a globe at the south pole and flattening it into a platter. A third dimension is obtained by tilting the platter. It was hypothesized that the Hybrid display would offer an advantage to C3 system operators and analysts dealing with three dimensional problems. The test plan focuses on perceptual parameters and user preference issues concerning conventional and Hybrid display techniques.

Now languages are being developed that are designed to be used by an infrequent or “casual” user who has limited knowledge of how the data is stored or retrieved by the computer. These special purpose query languages which allow these casual users to retrieve information from computer databases are commonly referred to as “nonprocedural” (Leavenworth and Sammet, 1974) because users need only describe the data to be retrieved, not how it is to be retrieved. These languages can be classified into two basic types which are characterized by the level of constraint imposed on the syntax and vocabulary of the language (Ehrenreich, 1981). Formal query languages have a very constrained syntax and vocabulary, while natural query languages have a relatively unconstrained syntax and vocabulary.If we consider the level of constraint that can be imposed on a query language as a continuum, then formal and natural query languages represent the two ends of this continuum. There has been considerable debate over the issue of which end of this continuum best meets the needs of the casual database user (e.g. Hill, 1972; Petrick, 1976; Shneiderman, 1980). Proponents of formal languages contend that these users benefit from learning a constrained language which teaches a concise and unambiguous way of communicating with the computer. Proponents of natural languages, on the other hand, contend that more people would be able to access database information if they could use their own natural languages. Evidence from studies of the use of some of these query languages however, indicate that neither formal, nor natural languages are easy to use. These studies suggest that the casual user will have difficulty operating at either end of the level-of-constraint continuum.",10,December 1983  ,Article ,CHI '83: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction paradigms', 'Natural language interfaces', 'Information systems', 'Data management systems', 'Query languages', 'Software and its engineering', 'Software notations and tools', 'Formal language definitions', 'Theory of computation', 'Formal languages and automata theory']"

In this context, moded editing means that the editor user must enter a special command before text is inserted and another special command to end the text insertion and return to the command mode. Ordinary printing characters typed while in an insertion mode are entered as text. The same characters entered while the editor is in the command mode are treated as commands.

Do users inevitably develop optimal strategies for getting their work done? The answer to such questions are becoming increasingly important, as more and more individuals begin to use word processing equipment routinely. In the best of all possible worlds, experienced users do become experts, able to quickly and accurately choose and execute optimal procedures to accomplish any given goal. Such a state of affairs would make designers of editing systems very happy indeed. But another alternative exists, that at least some proportion of experienced and frequent users stabilize at some nonoptimal level of skill.An initial survey of relevant research is encouraging. So, for example, Card, Moran, and Newell (1980) were able to deduce selection rules from experienced users' editing behavior that predicted 80% of their editing decisions, suggesting that experienced users have fairly well-defined heuristics for carrying out editing tasks. Tyler and Roth (1982) followed up on this work, demonstrating that novices were less likely to demonstrate selection rules than experienced users, preferring instead to rely on a single, sometimes inefficient, strategy. Finally, Folley and Williges (1982) demonstrated that when confronted with the description of a novel editor, users experienced on other systems make use of a greater number of commands in carrying out a paper-and-pencil application of the editor than do complete novices.",31,December 1983  ,Article ,CHI '83: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Applied computing', 'Document management and text processing', 'Document management', 'Text editing', 'Computing methodologies', 'Machine learning', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)']"

If recognized, the other person may say something to correct the misconception, and the conversation continues. Just as this is the case when people interact with each other, so must it be when users interact with a computer system. For example, in interacting with an expert system, a user may reveal misconceptions about objects modelled by the system. By failing to correct such misconceptions, the system may not only confirm the original misconception, but may cause the user to develop further misconceptions. It must therefore be up to the system to recognize and respond to misconceptions in an effective way. In this paper the space of possible object misconceptions is characterized according to the kind of incorrect information involved. It has been found that this characterization is often useful in determining how the user arrived at the misconception, and therefore the kind of information to include in the response. Using such a characterization, a system will be able to effectively correct object misconceptions in a domain independent way.

One group of naive users were taught step-by-step procedures for solving typical problems on the calculator. A second group of naive users were taught the same procedures in conjunction with an explicit model of the calculator's stack mechanism. The users then solved problems on the calculator while thinking aloud. Analysis of the performance of these two groups indicates that the model had little effect in routine problem solving situations, but significantly improved performance for novel problems. Analyses of the think-aloud protocols indicate that the users employed five distinct modes of problem solving: skilled methods, problem reduction strategies, a conversion algorithm, model-based problem space search, and methods-based problem space search. Skilled methods, problem reduction strategies and the conversion algorithm were used for solving more routine problems and did not necessarily depend on mental model knowledge. Problem space search was used in the novel problems. For the model users, the states and operations of the stack mechanism served as the problem space to be searched for a problem solution. In contrast, the no-model users employed a less effective search strategy based on the recombination of pieces of known procedures.

Logical mistakes manifest themselves as interfering with this aesthetics.The author suggests that in the area of software as well there is something like the absolute beautiful: perfect solutions with a maximum of transparence beyond all rivaling design parameters.

205,Documentation of concurrent programs,"['Deborah A. Boehm-Davis', 'Andrew M. Fregly']",https://doi.org/10.1145/800045.801622,"A complete software package always includes documentation. Although its importance is often overlooked, documentation may be the only source of program design information. Major tasks in the software life cycle, such as design, coding, testing and maintenance, are often performed by different individuals. Lientz and Swanson (1979) found that, typically, only about half of a software system's maintenance personnel had been involved in its development. Poor documentation techniques can, therefore, dramatically increase labor costs throughout the labor intensive software life cycle by making both development and maintenance tasks more difficult.Recent research in this area (Boehm-Davis, Sheppard, & Bailey, 1982; Sheppard, Kruesi, & Bailey, in press; Sheppard, Kruesi, & Curtis, 1981) has been directed toward determining performance on a set of software tasks as a function of the type of documentation. In these studies, programmer performance was examined on comprehension, coding, debugging, and modification tasks as a function of the type of documentation provided. The documentation formats were constructed from the factorial combination of three types of symbology with three types of spatial arrangement. These formats were chosen because they represent the primary dimensions for categorizing the way in which available documentation aids configure the information they present to programmers (Jones, 1979). The three types of symbology in which information was presented consisted of normal English, abbreviated English (such as program design language), and ideograms. The spatial arrangements of the information used in these experiments were sequential, branching, and hierarchical. While each of the four tasks pursued in this research produced slightly different results, there was a general trend towards the superiority of succinct symbology and a branching spatial arrangement in each.",0,December 1983  ,Article ,CHI '83: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Philosophical/theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence', 'Cognitive science', 'Concurrent computing methodologies', 'Concurrent programming languages', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Empirical studies in HCI', 'Software and its engineering', 'Software creation and management', 'Software post-development issues', 'Documentation', 'Software notations and tools', 'General programming languages', 'Language types', 'Concurrent programming languages']"

The two sites appeared to be polarized in terms of expected suitability for speech recognition. The variables looked at included task complexity, memory load, requirements for verification and error correction, vocabulary and syntax, microphone, operator experience and complexity of host computer software. Accuracy and throughput were measured for the speech recognition system at each site. The same measurements were made for keyboard entry. Operator differences account for most of the variance in results. Accuracy with voice input was higher than with keyboard for most operators. The most accurate operators with keyboard also tended to be the most accurate with voice. Throughput data appears more sensitive to individual differences in dealing with voice input, although the throughput data was clouded by slow host system response times overall. The discussion suggests that one to one replacement of keyboard with voice overlooks some possible advantages of voice. It is also possible to find operators who work well with voice. For those who do not work well with voice, the problems appear to be related to general work habits and attitude, rather than to specific difficulties with speech.",4,December 1983  ,Article ,CHI '83: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Speech recognition', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Information systems', 'Information retrieval', 'Evaluation of retrieval results']"

Progress indicators can be displayed on almost all types of output devices, and can be used with many different kinds of programs. Practical experience and formal experiments show that prograss indicators are an important and useful user-interface tool, and that they enhance the attractiveness and effectiveness of programs that incorporate them. This paper discusses why progress indicators are important. It includes the results of a formal experiment with progress indicators. One part of the experiment demonstrates that people prefer to have progress indicators. Another part attempted to replicate earlier findings to show that people prefer constant to variable response time in general, and then to show that this effect is reversed with progress indicators, but the results were not statistically significant. In fact, no significant preference for constant response time was shown, contrary to previously published results.",84,April 1985  ,Article ,CHI '85: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Computer graphics', 'Graphics systems and interfaces', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'HCI design and evaluation methods', 'Interaction devices', 'Graphics input devices', 'Interaction paradigms', 'Software and its engineering', 'Software notations and tools', 'Development frameworks and environments', 'Integrated and visual development environments']"
217,The utility of natural language interfaces (panel session),['Philip J. Hayes'],https://doi.org/10.1145/317456.317460,"Natural language interfaces are frequently proposed as a solution to the problems of “user-unfriendliness” present in many existing computer system interfaces. The panel will examine this claim, and discuss in what circumstances (if any) it is (or could be) true.As a starting point, let us define a natural language interface as an interface to a computer system that allows the user to control the system by English1 commands or queries. Sometimes the output seen by the user will also be in natural language. Currently, most natural language interfaces only accept typed, rather than spoken, input. Also, such interfaces typically can only handle input related to the restricted world of their underlying application, and moreover, only a subset (albeit expressively comprehensive) of that.Set against these advantages are the following standardly cited disadvantages:verboseness: English commands or queries can take many more keystrokes to enter than equivalent formal command lines or menu-based selection.coverage restrictions: Since current natural language interfaces cannot handle all natural language inputs, not even all those relevant to their domain of discourse, the user is faced with the task of learning what the system can and cannot deal with, usually by trial and error.Given these conflicting arguments, it seems better to avoid the general question of whether natural language interfaces are Good or Bad. Instead, the panel will concentrate on how the utility of natural language interfaces is affected by the environment (broadly conceived) in which they operate. We will also be concerned with how the utility of specific natural language or other types of interface can be determined in specific circumstances.Factors affecting the utility of natural language interfaces include:Type of user: Natural language interfaces are better suited to novice or casual users rather than expert or frequent users of a system. An expert or frequent user can afford the cost of learning a command language because of the terseness it allows. On the other hand, it may be more economical for a novice or infrequent user to enter a verbose natural language input than to find out the correct terse command line.Combination with other input types: It may be possible to build interfaces which combine natural language and other types of interface in way that retains the best features of both, while reducing the impact of their negative features.The above list of issues does not pretend to be comprehensive, out is intended as a basis for discussion. Many other issues will no doubt arise during the course of the panel.",2,April 1985  ,Article ,CHI '85: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'HCI design and evaluation methods', 'Interaction paradigms', 'Natural language interfaces']"

The tablet's main innovation is that it is capable of sensing more than one point of contact at a time. In addition to being able to provide position coordinates, the tablet also gives a measure of degree of contact, independently for each point of contact. In order to enable multi-touch sensing, the tablet surface is divided into a grid of discrete points. The points are scanned using a recursive area subdivision algorithm. In order to minimize the resolution lost due to the discrete nature of the grid, a novel interpolation scheme has been developed. Finally, the paper briefly discusses how multi-touch sensing, interpolation, and degree of contact sensing can be combined to expand our vocabulary in human-computer interaction.",105,April 1985  ,Article ,CHI '85: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction devices', 'Touch screens', 'Mathematics of computing', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Numerical analysis', 'Interpolation']"

However, the authors know of no attempt to appraise such imagery by using multiple human observation ratings.The effectiveness of curved surface imagery generated from polygon models was investigated in a judgment study. Research subjects evaluated sphere model imagery derived from several polygon densities and shading procedures including flat shading, shade interpolation (Gouraud) and normal interpolation (Phong). Results of the evaluations indicated that little was gained by reducing the average polygon areas below approximately 110 pixels per polygon for spheres of 95 pixel radii displayed on a 512 x 512 resolution monitor. Evaluations for both shade and normal interpolution placed polygon image quality reasonably close to an “ideal” image. Although the evaluations indicated that normal interpolation was slightly superior to the shade interpolation, shade interpolation required significantly less computation. Most significantly, results from this study provide strong support for the notion that polygons can be used effectively to produce smooth shaded imagery of curved surface models.",12,April 1985  ,Article ,CHI '85: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Computer graphics', 'Shape modeling', 'Parametric curve and surface models', 'Volumetric models', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'HCI design and evaluation methods', 'Theory of computation', 'Randomness, geometry and discrete structures', 'Computational geometry']"

One contribution involves evaluating existing or prototype systems, in order to assess usability and identify problems. Another involves contributing more directly to the design of systems in the first place: that is, not only evaluating systems but bringing to bear empirical methods and theoretical considerations that help specify what are plausible designs in the first place. The goal of this panel is to discuss four case studies emphasizing this role of cognitive human factors, and identify relevant methods and theoretical considerations.The panelists will present examples of prototypes or products to whose design they contributed, with the aim of characterizing the problem (or problems) they tried to solve, the approach to identifying a design solution for that problem, and evidence that the approach was useful.Robert Mack will discuss an editor prototype designed to get novices started doing meaningful work quickly and helping them to continue acquiring new skills, with virtually no explicit instruction. The prototype is being designed in large part by identifying key novice problems and expectations, and trying to design the interface to better accommodate these expectations. The first goal of getting novices started relatively quickly has been achieved but problems remain as novices try to acquire further text-editing skill. These problems — and solutions to them — are being identified through a process of iterative design and evaluation.Dennis Wixon will discuss implications for designing usable interfaces of the User-Derived-Interface project (Good, M., Whiteside, J., Wixon, D. and Jones, S., 1984). The project involved a simulation of a restricted natural language interface for an electronic mail system. The design process was driven by the behavioral goal of getting users started relatively quickly with little or no instruction or interface aids. Actual user interaction with the simulation coupled with iterative design and evaluation provided interface specifications. This prototype illustrates a number of techniques for bringing usability into the software engineering process.These presentations will discuss the role of empirical methods such as verbal protocol techniques for identifying user problems with existing computer systems (e.g., Lewis, 1982; Mack, Lewis & Carroll, 1983; Douglas & Moran, 1983), including variations aimed at identifying user expectations that may be able to guide design (e.g., Mack, 1984); interface simulations for studying user interactions again with the aim of letting user behavior guide interface design (e.g., Kelley, 1984; Good, Whiteside, Wixon & Jones, 1984), and iterative design and evaluation of interfaces, aimed at achieving behavioral goals (e.g., Carroll & Rosson, 1984; Gould & Lewis, 1983).",1,April 1985  ,Article ,CHI '85: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)']"

240,"Expanded design procedures for learnable, usable interfaces (panel session)",['Judith Reitman Olson'],https://doi.org/10.1145/317456.317483,"Designers of interactive computer systems have begun to incorporate a number of good techniques in the design process to insure that the system will be easy to learn and easy to use. Though not all design projects use all the steps recommended, the steps are well known:Define the tasks the user has to perform,Know the capabilities of the user,Gather relevant hardware/software constraints,From guidelines, design a first prototype,Test the prototype with users,Iterate changes in the design and repeat the tests until the deadline is reached.In our experience designing a new interface, steps 1 and 4 were the ones that were the most difficult and step 5 was the one that took extra time to plan well. We had difficulty defining what would go into a new task, and from broad guidelines, we had to develop one specific implementation for our tasks. Furthermore, so that in each test we would learn something of value for future designs, we knew that we wanted to test pairs of prototypes that differed in only one feature. Choosing which single feature to alter in each pair required careful planning. In what follows, I describe each of these difficulties more fully and show how we approached each in our environment.Normally, a task is defined as a computer-based analog of an existing task, such as wordprocessing being the computer-based analog of typing. Since we had to build an interface for an entirely new task, we had to invent how the user would think about the task. We had to invent the objects on which the user would operate and then the actions that would be performed on those objects. We had to specify the mental representation in the absence of previous similar tasks.In our case, we were designing the interface for a communications manager to designate the path to be taken for routing 800-calls to their final destination as a function of time of day, day of week, holidays, percentage distribution, etc. From the large set of known formal representations of data, e.g. lists, pictures, tables, hierarchies, and networks, we found three that seemed to capture the information sufficient for our task. We found that a hierarchy (tree structure), a restricted programming language in which there were only IF-THEN-ELSEs and definitions, and a long form to be filled out with all possible ordered combinations of the desired features, were all sufficient representations. We then asked potential users in casual interviews which format they found easiest to understand. It was immediately clear even from a relatively small number of subjects that the tree representation was preferred.The second aspect of defining the task involved specifying what actions the user would take on this representation. Since in all interfaces, users have to move about, select an item to work on, enter information, delete information, and change modes (from data entry to command, typically), we looked for these kinds of actions in our task. The actions immediately fell into place, with commands being generated for moving about a tree, entering nodes and branches, etc.After gathering information on who the end users were and what hardware constraints we had, we designed our first prototype. This was our next most involved chore. Our broad guidelines said that we should:
Present information on the computer in a representation as close as possible to the user's mental representation.Minimize the long-term and short-term memory loads (e.g. make retrieval of commands and codes easy, give the user clues about where he or she is in a complicated procedure or data structure).Construct a dialog that holds to natural conversational conventions (e.g., make pauses predictable, acknowledge long delays, use English imperative structure in the command syntax).Our initial design on paper was fairly easy to construct. We followed that, however, with an important analysis step before we built our first prototype. For each part of the design, we constructed an alternative design that seemed to fit within the same constraints and within the guidelines. That is, we identified the essential components of our interface: the representation of the data, the organization of the command sector, the reminders, and the specific command implementations such as how to move around the data representation. For example, in the command sector there are alternative ways to arrange the commands for display: they could be grouped by similar function so that all “move” commands were clustered and all “entry” commands were clustered, etc, or they could be grouped into common sequences, such as those that people naturally follow in initially entering the nodes and branches of the tree structures. Once each component had an alternative, we debated the merits of each. Our first prototype, then, was the result of this first paper design plus the alterations that were generated by this analysis procedure.The next step entailed testing our design with real users. Since we wanted to test our prototypes so that we learned something useful for our next assignment, we chose to test two prototypes at a time. If we were to learn something from the test, then only one component could differ between the two prototypes. The difficulty arose in deciding which component was to be tested in each pair. For this task, we went back to our initial component-by-component debate about the prototype. For each of the components and its alternative, we scored the choice on three dimensions:That is, first, for some alternatives, the better choice was predictable. For example, displaying command names was known to be more helpful than not displaying them. Testing this alternative would not teach us very much. Second, we needed to choose some alternatives early, so that the developers could begin immediately with some preliminary work. For example, our developers needed to know early whether the data would be displayed as a form or a tree so they could set up appropriate data structures. And third, some alternatives would appear again in future design projects. For example, all projects require some way of moving about the data but few deal directly with trees. Knowledge gained now about the movement function would pay off in the future whereas how to display trees may not.Once we prioritized our alternatives on these dimensions, we were able to choose the alternative for the first prototype test. After the test, we found other ideas to incorporate in the next iteration, but went through the same analysis procedure, listing the components, debating alternatives, and prioritizing those to be tested in the next iteration.In summary, the procedure we followed in designing and testing our prototypes was standard in overall form, flowing from defining the task, user, and constraints; building prototypes; and testing them with users. We differed, however, in three of our steps. We spent important initial time considering the best task representation to display to the user. We analyzed the individual components of our first prototype, generating a design for actual implementation that was more defensibly good than our first paper design.And, in our iterative testing procedure, we selected pairs of prototypes for test, the pairs differing on only one component of the design. The component for testing was selected according to whether the test would teach us something, whether it was important to decide early in the development process, and whether the component would appear again in designs we encountered in the future. These expanded steps in the design process not only added to our confidence that our early design was reasonably good, but also gave us the data and theory with which to convince others, notably developers and project managers, of the merit of our design. And, the process taught us something of use for our next design project.",3,April 1985  ,Article ,CHI '85: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)']"

The choices are examined in terms of a general model of a UIMS. They concern the sharing of control between the UIMS and the applications it provides interfaces to, the level of abstraction in the definition of the information exchanged between user and application, and the level of abstraction in the definition of the sequencing of the dialogue. For each choice, we argue for a specific alternative. We go on to present COUSIN, a UIMS that provides graphical interfaces for a variety of applications based on highly abstracted interface definitions.

With ADM the application designer writes the underlying application in a conventional programming language and defines the interface between interaction handler and underlying application in terms of “tasks,” things the user can do, and “states,” sets of tasks that are active at one time. The user interface designer defines the interaction handler in terms of “presentation techniques,” which present tasks to the user, and “structuring techniques,” which describe screen layout.

Training and recognition were done from tape recordings, with the playback level of the tape was always set to the same, intermediate level.

255,The information lens: an intelligent system for information sharing in organizations,"['T. W. Malone', 'K. R. Grant', 'F. A. Turbak']",https://doi.org/10.1145/22627.22340,"This paper describes an intelligent system to help people share and filter information communicated by computer-based messaging systems. The system exploits concepts from artificial intelligence such as frames, production rules, and inheritance networks, but it avoids the unsolved problems of natural language understanding by providing users with a rich set of semi-structured message templates. A consistent set of “direct manipulation” editors simplifies the use of the system by individuals, and an incremental enhancement path simplifies the adoption of the system by groups.One of the key problems that arises when any group of people cooperates to solve problems or make decisions is how to share information. Thus one of the central goals of designing good “organizational interfaces” (Malone, 1985) should be to help people share information in groups and organizations. In this paper, we will describe a prototype system, called the Information Lens, that focuses on one aspect of this problem: how to help people share the many diverse kinds of qualitative information that are communicated via electronic messaging systems.It is already a common experience in mature computer-based messaging communities for people to feel flooded with large quantities of electronic “junk mail” (Denning, 1982; Palme, 1984; Wilson, 1984; Hiltz & Turoff, 1985), and the widespread availability of inexpensive communication capability has the potential to overwhelm people with even more messages that are of little or no value to them. At the same time, it is also a common experience for people to be ignorant of facts that would facilitate their work and that are known elsewhere in their organization. The system we will describe helps solve both these problems: it helps people filter, sort, and prioritize messages that are already addressed to them, and it also helps them find useful messages they would not otherwise have received.The most common previous approach to structuring information sharing in electronic messaging environments is to let users implicitly specify their general areas of interest by associating themselves with centralized distribution lists or conference topics related to particular subjects (e.g., Hiltz & Turoff, 1978). Since these methods of disseminating information are often targeted for relatively large audiences, however, it is usually impossible for all the information distributed to be of interest to all recipients.The Information Lens system uses much more detailed representations of message contents and receivers' interests to provide more sophisticated filtering possibilities. One of the key ideas behind this system is that many of the unsolved problems of natural language understanding can be avoided by using semi-structured templates (or frames) for different types of messages. These templates are used by the senders of messages to facilitate composing messages in the first place. Then, the same templates are used by the receivers of messages to facilitate constructing a set of rules to be used for filtering and categorizing messages of different types.",50,April 1986  ,Article ,CHI '86: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Applied computing', 'Life and medical sciences', 'Computing methodologies', 'Symbolic and algebraic manipulation', 'Symbolic and algebraic algorithms', 'Linear algebra algorithms', 'Human-centered computing', 'Collaborative and social computing', 'Collaborative and social computing systems and tools', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Information systems', 'Information retrieval', 'Search engine architectures and scalability', 'Peer-to-peer retrieval', 'World Wide Web', 'Web applications', 'Internet communications tools', 'Email', 'Web searching and information discovery', 'Mathematics of computing', 'Discrete mathematics', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Differential equations', 'Ordinary differential equations', 'Numerical analysis', 'Computations on matrices', 'Social and professional topics', 'Computing / technology policy', 'Government technology policy']"

The results also show that the speed of performing the task was strongly correlated to the degree of parallelism employed.Experiment two involved the performance of a compound navigation/selection task. It compared a one-handed versus two-handed method for finding and selecting words in a document. The two-handed method significantly outperformed the commonly used one-handed method by a number of measures. Unlike experiment one, only two subjects adopted strategies that used both hands simultaneously. The benefits of the two-handed technique, therefore, are interpreted as being due to efficiency of hand motion. However, the two subjects who did use parallel strategies had the two fastest times of all subjects.",285,April 1986  ,Article ,CHI '86: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Computer graphics', 'Graphics systems and interfaces', 'Graphics input devices', 'Hardware', 'Communication hardware, interfaces and storage', 'Human-centered computing', 'Accessibility', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Empirical studies in HCI', 'Interaction devices', 'Graphics input devices', 'Information systems', 'Data management systems', 'Database administration', 'Data dictionaries', 'Database design and models', 'Software and its engineering', 'Software notations and tools', 'Development frameworks and environments', 'Integrated and visual development environments', 'General programming languages', 'Language types']"

Three experiments involving questions of the psychology of blinking time were conducted. The first experiment examined subjects' preconceived notions of optimum blinking time, i.e. what they imagined, within their own minds, such times would be for specific text portions. The second experiment determined the gap between those preconceived notions and the subjects' changed concepts of optimum blinking times, based on their experience of visual  trials. The third experiment applied a scale of blinking times, based on the experience gained in the second experiment, to a new set of subjects in order to further refine our understanding of optimum intervals.

Here we summarize results from a few of our fifteen experiments that have led us to conclude that the explanation centers on the image quality of the CRT characters. Reading speeds equivalent to those on paper were found when the CRT displays contained character fonts that resembled those on paper (rather than dot matrix fonts, for example), had a polarity of dark characters on a light background, were anti-aliased (e.g., contained grey level), and were shown on displays with relatively high resolution (e.g., 1000 x 800). Each of these variables probably contributes something to the improvement, but the trade-offs have not been determined. Other general explanations for the reading speed difference that can be excluded include some inherent defect in CRT technology itself or personal variables such as age, experience, or familiarity at reading from CRT displays.",20,May 1986  ,Article ,CHI '87: Proceedings of the SIGCHI/GI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems and Graphics Interface,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'HCI design and evaluation methods']"

The first part of the experiment comprised a subjective rating of image quality, the second part measured task effectiveness of image quality. In the second part subjects were asked to discriminate between images of two types of objects built from cubes, similar to objects used in experiments involving mental rotation.At higher resolutions the elimination of aliasing artifacts did not significantly improve subjects' performance. At intermediate and low resolutions, comparable to what might be used for iconic menus, the reduction in aliasing artifacts resulted in improved performance. The subjective ratings indicate that for both high and low resolution the elimination of aliasing artifacts does not improve “quality,” whereas images rendered at intermediate resolutions are significantly degraded by aliasing artifacts to the extent that antialiasing improves the subjective rating.An interpretation of these results is given in the context of an ongoing research program aimed at identifying the parameters of real-time human performance for graphics workstations.",7,May 1986  ,Article ,CHI '87: Proceedings of the SIGCHI/GI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems and Graphics Interface,"['Computing methodologies', 'Computer graphics', 'Image manipulation', 'Rendering', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'HCI design and evaluation methods']"

A virtual workspace design is presented that greatly speeds the inevitable task-switching induced window faulting. The resulting interface is presented as a study in theory-based human-interface design.

Users manipulate objects with a mouse-operated “hand” which enables them to carry and throw objects, to press buttons, and to operate sliders.The interface features are discussed in light of a general user interface tension between literalism and magic. Literal features are defined to be those that are true to the interface's metaphor. Literal features enhance an interface's learnability. Magical features are defined to be those capabilities that deliberately violate the metaphor in order to provide enhanced functionality. Discussion of each ARK feature includes informal observations of early ARK users, an assessment of the feature's learnability, of its usefulness, and of its position on the magical-literal axis.Even though ARK includes magical features, applications-level users have be trained in a few minutes.

In this symposium, we consider the applicability to system design of approaches that focus on social interaction. The participants comprise pairs of researchers engaged in projects that aim to bring together systematic studies of naturally occurring human activities with the design of computer-based technology. Each of the projects emphasizes the importance of the social organization of communities, everyday communication and practice.The symposium participants — anthropologists, linguists and computer scientists — bring interdisciplinary perspectives to bear on the problem of how to design tools that incorporate the right mix of support for current work practices, solutions to recognized problems, and innovations in the way that work gets done. The aim of the symposium is to explore the possibilities for a productive relationship between research on socially organized human activities and system design.In this forum we will examine the problems that such interdisciplinary efforts face and the payoffs that they produce. Drawing on experience with their respective research projects, the participants will address the following questions concerning the development of a design process grounded in empirical studies:what is the relevance of activity studies to the design of new technology? What people do in everyday work settings is an obvious subject matter for social science, but just what is the relationship between that subject matter and system design? What part should an understanding of what people do now, with existing technological resources, play in the design of new technologies?How has new technology changed the nature of everyday work activities? The technological resources available in the domain of intellectual work, for example, are continually changing. Given this moving technological base, new forms of interaction between people emerge. What are the implications of those new forms, made possible by system design, for social science research?What social theory and methods do you draw on in your studies of work practice? What are the difficult theoretical or methodological problems, and what are the consequences of looking at everyday activities with the aim of designing new technology?What is the motivation behind your system design effort? That is, what problem in the domain of interest is your design intended to address?How has your design approach been affected by your empirical research?How has working with your collaborator changed your view of the problem domain? What has been most difficult about your collaboration and what has been most valuable? How have you negotiated differences in technical background, methods, conceptualization of the problem domain?To ground the discussion, participants will offer examples from their ongoing research projects. Brief descriptions of those projects are included here, but the symposium is intended as a lively debate of the questions posed, not as a presentation of findings.

More basic problems concern what functions should be included in the system and how the users can understand what the system can do in different work situations and how the response should be evaluated in the context of the work situations. This is demonstrated by experiences from application projects. It is concluded that more research must be devoted to these problem areas.

Each component of an actor has its primitive motion method. To achieve complicated actions, primitive motions are combined. Referring to these complicated actions, the action generating module produces animated sequences from the adapted scenario. These three modules are tightly coupled with their knowledge bases.

The goal of such systems has been to automate the production of user interface software. The problem of building quality user interfaces within available resources is a very important one as the demand for new interactive programs grows. Prototype UIMSs have been built and some software packages are presently being marketed as such. Many papers have been published on the topic.There still, however, remain a number of unanswered questions. Is a UIMS an effective tool for building high quality user interfaces or is the run-time cost of abstracting out the user interface too high? Why are there not more UIMSs available and why are they not more frequently used? Is simple programmer productivity alone sufficient motivation for learning and adopting yet another programming tool? What is the difference, if any, between a “user interface toolbox”, a windowing system and a UIMS? What are the differences between a UIMS and the screen and editor generators found in fourth generation languages? In fact, exactly what is a UIMS?In order to discuss these questions and to reassess the state of the UIMS art, SIGGRAPH sponsored a workshop on these issues (proceedings will be published in Computer Graphics in 1987).

366,The social dimensions of computerization,['Rob Kling'],https://doi.org/10.1145/29933.275654,"While industrialized countries have been rapidly computerizing, the ultimate forms of computerization and their social consequences are still somewhat open-ended. The general directions of equipment developments have been relatively clear - toward computer-based systems which run on faster, smaller, and cheaper hardware; toward equipment architectures which distribute computing (and work); and software which is generally more flexible and more likely to support graceful interactions between person and machine. Computerization is more than placing computing equipment in offices, homes, boats, planes, automobiles, or shopping areas. Computerization refers to the social practices through which computer-based systems and services are made available to various groups, arrangements for training people in the variety of skills they need to use systems effectively, practices that alter accountability, changes in patterns of control, etc. Computerization is a combination of technical, social and political processes [12].Computerization touches the lives of millions of people in many key spheres of work, education, commerce, dealing with public agencies, etc. It is tempting to find some simple formula to summarize the consequences of computerization for people, groups, and the larger social order. Simple capsule formulas which concisely summarize a meaning for computerization tend to be deterministic and grossly oversimplified [11]. Our most reliable knowledge about the specific social consequences of computerization comes from careful field studies of specific computer-based systems in specific social settings [10]. There are a myriad of systems and settings and varied computerization practices employed throughout the industrialized nations. Moreover, analysts bring their own differing theoretical assumptions to their studies [6, 10, 22]. Consequently, the findings of research studies sometimes appear inconsistent [1, 10, 19, 21]. There are serious debates about whether computerization will naturally lead to better or worse jobs [4, 7, 8, 17, 23, 24], lead people to make better or worse decisions [20], lead work groups to be more or less flexible [17], reinforce or redistribute patterns of social power [3], make bureacracies less accountable to the public [2], etc.Much of the popular and professional discourse about the consequences and conditions of computer use is relatively deterministic. Deterministic stories can be optimistic [5] or pessimistic [7, 23]. During the last decade scholars have begun to develop some interesting explanatory models to help understand how computerization ""works"" as a social and technical process. Research on the social impacts of computing indicates that few ""deterministic"" consequences of introducing computer-based systems into social settings such as organizations [12, 18, 20, 25]. Under different conditions and different computerization strategies, jobs may become more or less skilled; work groups may gain or lose flexibility; decisions may be ""better"" or more confused; power may shift to or from central administrators, etc. Changes such as these depend upon both social and technical contingencies, such as: the kinds of systems introduced, who controls them, the kind of infrastructure devoted to their support, etc [17]. Computer-based systems which can be perfectable under static laboratory conditions and when supported by a rich array of resources may be very problematic when introduced into dynamic social settings, settings rife with social conflict, or when computerization strategies limit support resources. Contextual characteristics, such as these, are a powerful influence on the kinds of computer-based systems adopted, the ways they are organized, and their consequences for people and groups. As a consequence, the simple development of ""good technologies"" is not sufficient to insure that social life will be improved for many participants.This talk will examine some organizing ideas to help understand how computerization strategies and their outcomes depend upon the social contexts in which people sad groups enact them by introducing web models [14,18]. Web models examine the social context in which a computer-based system is adopted, developed, or used; they view the infrastructure for supporting a computer-based system as an integral element of its operational form; and they situate the computing developments being studies in light of the history of related computing developments and related social practices within key social settings. The examples for this talk will be drawn primarily from the computerization of workplaces.Web models help explain 1) the social leverage provided by computing arrangements; 2) the co-requisites for smoothly operating systems; and 3) the ways in which the social settings in which computing arrangements are developed and used shape their configurations and consequences.We contrast web models with conventionally rational ""discrete-entity"" models which are a-contextual, a-historical, and assume that adequate infrastructure can always be available as needed. Predictions of computing development sad use based on discrete-entity models usually underestimate the problems of implementation and underestimate the extent to which computer-based systems play important roles other than as direct aids in leveraging information processing capabilities in a work organization.Web models shed greater light on socially and technically complex, embedded computing developments than do discrete-entity models. At best, discrete-entity models account for some of the potential (dis)advantages provided by a new technology or organizational arrangements. Since they are context-free, discrete-entity models can be used to describe the results of many simple experiments. In discrete-entity analyses, all things being equal is the rule, while the social setting of technical development and use is largely ignored. That neglect is usually untenable when the organizational setting or the technology itself is complex. Even simple technologies may be compromised by complex, demanding settings [13].Web models draw ""large"" social boundaries around a focal computing resource so that the defining situation includes: the ecology of participants who influence the adoption and use of computer-based technologies, the infrastructures for supporting system development and use, and the history of local computing developments [3, 8, 13, 16].The social boundaries for a given computing resource can extend far beyond the work places where it is developed and used. Useful social boundaries contain work groups laced throughout a given organization and through other organizations on which the focal organization depends for resources such as staff, equipment, income, and legitimacy. These boundaries are often ir- regular in that they often do not conform to the formal boundaries of organizations and their subunits. They can also be idiosyncratic in that they differ from one organizational setting to another, even when the same technologies are in use. Within these social boundaries, web models link computing developments to routine organizational activities and critical negotiations.Web models help explain the actual leverage of computing developments, their carrying costs, and the ways that systems are valued by different participants. Computer-based systems increasingly extend beyond the narrow boundaries of a work group or small scale organizational unit and are increasingly an element in more complex social relations. Consequently, discrete-entity models are becoming less relevant as a basis for guiding research on the social dimensions of computerization. Web models of computing appear especially appropriate when 1) the production or support of computer-based systems is socially complex or 2) their adoption or operation depends upon social relations that extend far beyond the behavioral setting in which the technology is developed or used. Web models examine the social simplicity/complexity of computing arrangements, not just their technical simplicity/complexity. As computer-based systems become more socially complex, web models will become increasingly critical as approaches for explaining the development and use of computing.",5,May 1986  ,Article ,CHI '87: Proceedings of the SIGCHI/GI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems and Graphics Interface,"['Applied computing', 'Law, social and behavioral sciences', 'Sociology', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Social and professional topics', 'Professional topics', 'Computing and business']"

Humans frequently lipread the visible facial speech articulations to enhance speech recognition, especially when the acoustic signal is degraded by noise or hearing impairment. Automatic lipreading has been found to improve significantly acoustic speech recognition and could be advantageous in noisy environments such as offices, aircraft and factories.An improved version of a previously described automatic lipreading system has been developed which uses vector quantization, dynamic time warping, and a new heuristic distance measure.

A pie menu is a format where the items are placed along the circumference of a circle at equal radial distances from the center. Pie menus gain over traditional linear menus by reducing target seek time, lowering error rates by fixing the distance factor and increasing the target size in Fitts's Law, minimizing the drift distance after target selection, and are, in general, subjectively equivalent to the linear style.",202,May 1988  ,Article ,CHI '88: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Computer graphics', 'Graphics systems and interfaces', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction devices', 'Graphics input devices']"

Devoting human and computer resources to user interface enhancement has been considered a luxury, and in many places still is, but the falling cost of computational power and the growing user resistance to poor interfaces, as well as a rising need for product differentiation in the marketplace, insure that human factors will become a necessity where it has not already. The need to develop organizational approaches to support the integration of human factors or user interface expertise with product development is thus a relatively new concern. The integration problems that have been identified include some that are shared with more established support activities such as technical writing, and others that are particular to human factors or result from the relative unfamiliarity of the discipline.Approaches that have been taken to managing human factors resources in order to maximize influence on user interface development include: hiring human factors engineers or psychologists directly into development teams, concentrating human factors engineers in a support organization, making use of external consultants with user interface knowledge, placing a development group under the leadership of a human factors professional, and forming an educational center in which software engineers learn about human factors approaches.

Formal query languages, menus, and direct manipulation interfaces might not suffice to access advisory systems' full functionality. The capabilities of natural language interfaces could be required. Unfortunately, natural language interfaces are not meeting the needs yet. Wide syntactic coverage is often traded off against handling ungrammatical sentences. However, this study shows that users request help with a very simple and restricted English, characteristic of unplanned or of child language. Moreover, users' utterances are frequently ungrammatical. It is argued that the simple syntax and the ungrammaticalities are determined by features intrinsic to advisory systems: users request help by typing to perform another primary task under real-time production constraints. Because of intrinsic performance constraints, users naturally resort to earlier and simpler forms of syntax.

Rather, we intend to approach it from the perspective of the information user: reader, searcher, author. The panel will address the following issues:
Are the processes of authoring and understanding helped or hindered by the non-linear structure of hypertext, for which kinds of tasks and users? What is the difference between a hypertext writer and a knowledge engineer? In searching for information, what is the difference between browsing and querying?What experiments need to be done? What tools, environment or interfaces can improve the process of information creation and access? Can the overhead of creating or interpreting structure be reduced?When will hypertext replace paper, or should it? How do functions of author and reader co-evolve?

Several researchers argue that programmers utilize plan-based representations when composing or comprehending code. In this study we tested the psychological validity of this proposal and examined the nature of plan-based program representations. Experienced programmers were asked to segment code and sort programs. The segmenting data showed that programmers agree on the major components of a program and that these components are defined by goals in a plan representation. Pascal and FORTRAN programs that employ the same plan structure were segmented into similar components. Program sorting data also showed clustering into plan groups. However task related dimensions are also important parts of program representations.,4,May 1988  ,Article ,CHI '88: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Social and professional topics', 'Professional topics', 'Management of computing and information systems', 'Software management', 'Software and its engineering', 'Software creation and management', 'Designing software', 'Software notations and tools', 'General programming languages', 'Language features', 'Modules / packages', 'Language types']"

Most approaches to retrieving textual materials depend on a lexical match between words in users' requests and those in or assigned to database objects. Because of the tremendous diversity in the words people use to describe the same object, lexical matching methods are necessarily incomplete and imprecise [5]. The latent semantic indexing approach tries to overcome these problems by automatically organizing text objects into a semantic structure more appropriate for matching user requests. This is done by taking advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with text objects. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by text-object matrix is decomposed into a set of about 50 to 150 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Terms and objects are represented by 50 to 150 dimensional vectors and matched against user queries in this “semantic” space. Initial tests find this completely automatic method widely applicable and a promising way to improve users' access to many kinds of textual materials, or to objects and services for which textual descriptions are available.",225,May 1988  ,Article ,CHI '88: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Applied computing', 'Arts and humanities', 'Language translation', 'Document management and text processing', 'Document preparation', 'Document scripting languages', 'Computing methodologies', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Information systems', 'Information retrieval', 'Document representation', 'Retrieval models and ranking', 'Search engine architectures and scalability', 'Search engine indexing']"

Levels of abstraction are readily applied to allow definition of primitive tasks for sharing and reusability and to allow hiding of details for chunking.

489,Redefining tomorrow's user interface (plenary address),['Michael L. Dertouzos'],https://doi.org/10.1145/97243.97244,"When computers first appeared, input-output commands were minor afterthoughts to cohesive, often well crafted and occasionally pretentious programming languages. Today, these commands occupy over 70 percent of a programming system's instructions. Yet they, along with the user interface structures that they define, are far from cohesive, and, at least up until now, immune to standardization. We must therefore turn our thinking around and create a new breed of programming languages that are first and foremost input-output oriented and that integrate traditional processing commands into new user-oriented structures. And just as we know today that traditional commands fall into a handful of fixed categories - decision, repetition, naming, procedure definition and use — we need to search for and identify the corresponding natural classes of commands for user interfaces.But even if user interfaces were ideally programmed in divine new languages, they would still be ineffective, under our current mindset. For it is an unfortunate fact that despite a great deal of hype about look and feel, today's user interfaces have not appreciably reduced the difficulty of interaction between humans and machines. How can we explain, for example, the disturbing paradox that although computing accounts for some 10 percent of the U.S. G.N.P., it has not resulted in any measurable gains in conventionally measured productivity except in very few areas, like computer aided design. In fact, among office workers, net productivity seems to have decreased during the same period that computer purchases and uses have surged.Let us then ask what we should do in tomorrow's user interfaces to increase productivity and empower people, as the theme of this conference charges. In simpler terms, let us turn our attention on what we can do to help ordinary mortals who are trying to get a job done in spite of the well meaning efforts of hardware and software designers and managers. I, for one, believe that we can do a great deal and can improve immensely human-computer productivity.For example, we can ensure that people do not succumb to the additive fault of doing in the computer age, all that they did before plus a whole set of new actions — this is one of the most common ways of wasting human work. We should also avoid the learning fault by trying to reduce radically the amount of new knowledge that must be learned and retained by information workers, even if the resultant power and flexibility loom seductively before us. And we should design our systems and procedures so that they do not encourage the perfection fault, i.e. working on our systems well beyond the point of diminishing returns, in the interest of perfection.Much more can and should be done, for example by making user interfaces smarter so that they can anticipate, even small portions of our intent, instead of brutally forcing us through a litany of repetitive and dumb rituals. And we should ensure that our machines enable and enhance rather than fight human-to-human interaction and coordination, which is such an important part of our everyday productive activity.These issues and observations raise serious questions of balance among extremes that are today either addressed indirectly or downright ignored. For example, in tomorrow's interface, will users crave for aesthetics or intelligence? Flexibility and power, or simplicity? Integration or isolation of disparate user systems? A brave new world of flat screens, 3-d CRT goggles and speech and gesture detectors, — or more effective use of blander systems? And what are we going to do to plan, measure and ensure that the vocabulary of user intent is well matched by the vocabulary of interface actions?It is these kinds of questions that we need to address from the common-sense perspective of making computers effective and useful to ordinary people. No one is potentially better suited for doing this than the professional whose responsibility is the interface between people and machines. But to do this, we need to redefine the profession, from its current narrow confines of dealing with windows, mice and ergonomic factors to a far broader discipline that encompasses and seeks to improve everything that humans and computers do together, including purpose — in other words the total user interface of and for tomorrow.",7,March 1990  ,Article ,CHI '90: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Social and professional topics', 'Computing / technology policy']"

495,Using constraints to achieve stability in automatic graph layout algorithms,"['Karl-Friedrich Böhringer', 'Frances Newbery Paulisch']",https://doi.org/10.1145/97243.97250,"Automatic layout algorithms are commonly used when displaying graphs on the screen because they provide a “nice” drawing of the graph without user intervention. There are, however, a couple of disadvantages to automatic layout. Without user intervention, an automatic layout algorithm is only capable of producing an aesthetically pleasing drawing of the graph. User- or application-specified layout constraints (often concerning the semantics of a graph) are difficult or impossible to specify. A second problem is that automatic layout algorithms seldom make use of information in the current layout when calculating the new layout. This can also be frustrating to the user because whenever a new layout is done, the user's orientation in the graph is lost.This paper suggests using layout constraints to solve both of these problems. We show how user-specified layout constraints may be easily added to many automatic graph layout algorithms. Additionally, the constraints specified by the current layout are used when calculating the new layout to achieve a more stable layout. This approach allows a continuum between manual and automatic layout by allowing the user to specify how stable the graph's layout should be.",44,March 1990  ,Article ,CHI '90: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Computer graphics', 'Graphics systems and interfaces', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction devices', 'Graphics input devices', 'Mathematics of computing', 'Discrete mathematics', 'Graph theory', 'Theory of computation', 'Design and analysis of algorithms', 'Approximation algorithms analysis', 'Routing and network design problems']"

Like conventional snapping, or gravity fields, semantic snapping includes a geometric component where objects in close proximity are drawn together or “snap” into position. However, semantic snapping goes further by allowing non-geometric (semantic) properties of objects to place additional constraints on snapping. Semantic snapping also provides more complex lexical feedback which reflects potential semantic consequences of a snap. This paper motivates the use of semantic snapping and describes how this technique has been implemented in a window-based toolkit. This implementation works in an adaptive manner to provide the best interactive response in situations where semantic tests are very time consuming and strain the limits of acceptable performance.",11,March 1990  ,Article ,CHI '90: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Computer graphics', 'Graphics systems and interfaces', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction devices', 'Graphics input devices', 'Software and its engineering', 'Software notations and tools', 'Development frameworks and environments', 'Integrated and visual development environments']"

Working with other members of the Research and Development community, we strive to develop high quality user interfaces. We bring special expertise in the design of graphical user interfaces for customer network management, in the design of interfaces for voice-based network services, and in the use of state-of-the-art technology for documentation and training. Our work covers products and services for users both outside of AT&T and inside AT&T (e.g., attendants and technicians). The User Interface and Quality Planning Department also plays a leadership role in maintaining a company-wide community of behavioral scientists.The department consists of four user interface groups and one quality planning group. With quality planning and user interface design in the same department, we can effectively highlight the importance of the user interface to the user's perception of quality. The user interface groups are directly funded by AT&T business units for user interface design work on specific products and services.Bruce Fetz is the Department Head; there are four user interface supervisors and about 23 Members of Technical Staff (MTS). The supervisors and MTS have doctorates in some area of experimental psychology; many also have a strong background in computer science. In addition, there are several laboratory support people, and we bring in software developers as they are needed on specific projects. Our user interface laboratory has development, testing, and presentation rooms, with flexible configuration and communication capabilities. Our equipment includes a high-capacity network of Sun workstations, and state-of-the-art audio/video production and editing equipment.Our philosophy regarding human factors work in service and product development has two major themes. First, human factors specialists should work as full team members with the product planners, systems engineers and developers responsible for a service or product. Second, human factors specialists should be involved as team members throughout the entire product realization process — from initial concept, through design and development, to customer evaluation after the product or service has been introduced.Rapid prototyping (of both voice-based user interfaces and graphical user interfaces) is central to our design process. Prototypes allow us to try out design concepts, to obtain feedback from users at every stage of the design process, to communicate our ideas more effectively, and to conduct laboratory evaluations. At the end of the design process, prototypes often serve as the “user interface requirements” for a product.In addition to product-specific efforts, we also engage in exploratory design and development using new user interface technologies. Also, department members contribute to the creation and evaluation of user interface standards that support the consistency of user interfaces across different products and services.",0,March 1990  ,Article ,CHI '90: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Computer graphics', 'Graphics systems and interfaces', 'Hardware', 'Communication hardware, interfaces and storage', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction devices', 'Graphics input devices', 'Interaction paradigms', 'Natural language interfaces', 'Networks']"

By formal methods we mean mathematical models that are capable of capturing properties of a user interface. By empirical methods we mean the observation and measurement of user behaviour. Integration of these two approaches is achieved by an iterative design process in which formal models are successively refined by testing their predictions against the results of user trials.,0,March 1990  ,Article ,CHI '90: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Applied computing', 'Operations research', 'Decision analysis', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Information systems', 'Information systems applications', 'Decision support systems']"

The discussion of the results centers around the application of Fitts' Law to pointing and dragging in a point-drag sequence, proposing that the target for pointing is the leftmost edge of the text to be selected, and the target for dragging is the rightmost edge of the text.",42,March 1990  ,Article ,CHI '90: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Computer graphics', 'Graphics systems and interfaces', 'Graphics input devices', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction devices', 'Graphics input devices']"

Polson', 'Cathleen Wharton', 'John Rieman']",https://doi.org/10.1145/97243.97279,The value of theoretical analyses in user interface design has been hotly debated. All sides agree that it is difficult to apply current theoretical models within the constraints of real-world development projects. We attack this problem in the context of bringing the theoretical ideas within a model of exploratory learning [19] to bear on the evaluation of alternative interfaces for walk-up-and-use systems. We derived a “cognitive walkthrough” procedure for systematically evaluating features of an interface in the context of the theory. Four people independently applied this procedure to four alternative interfaces for which we have empirical usability data. Consideration of the walkthrough sheds light on the consistency with which such a procedure can be applied as well as the accuracy of the results.,172,March 1990  ,Article ,CHI '90: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Knowledge representation and reasoning', 'Philosophical/theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence', 'Machine learning', 'Machine learning approaches', 'Rule learning', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)']"

The term “user interface” was not needed in the beginning, when most users were engineers and programmers; it may again become inappropriate when more applications are written for groups than for individuals. But there is a continuity to the outward movement of the computer's interface to its external environment, from hardware to software to increasingly higher-level cognitive capabilities and finally to social processes. As the focus shifts, the approaches to design and the skills required of practitioners changes. In this paper five foci or levels of development are identified. Most development today is positioned in the third level and considerable research is directed at the fourth. Some attention is now being given to the fifth: repositioning the interface in the work group or organization itself. Work at the different levels is not entirely independent, so establishing a comprehensive framework may enable us to position existing research and development efforts and plan future work more effectively.",132,March 1990  ,Article ,CHI '90: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Computer graphics', 'Graphics systems and interfaces', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction devices', 'Graphics input devices', 'Social and professional topics', 'Professional topics', 'History of computing', 'Software and its engineering', 'Software notations and tools', 'Development frameworks and environments', 'Integrated and visual development environments']"

Adopting a developmental approach means using longitudinal research methods, building developmental sequence models of the acquisition of expertise, and analyzing tasks as scenarios specific to developmental levels. The psychology of programming seems particularly amenable to a developmental approach because of the length of time that it takes to become an expert. We propose a model of seven developmental levels for Smalltalk/V programming, and provide sample scenarios for each level.

From the engineer's perspective, the ideal interface reflects the underlying mechanism and affords direct access to the control points of the mechanism. The designer of the user interface is often also the designer of the mechanism (or at least is very familiar with the mechanism), and thus has a strong bias toward basing the interface on the engineering model. The user, however, wants to complete a task, and an interface that is based on the task is often more appropriate than one based on the system mechanism. We discuss these issues, and also discuss where to position the user interface between the poles of the engineering model and the task model.",17,March 1990  ,Article ,CHI '90: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interactive systems and tools', 'Interaction design', 'Social and professional topics', 'Professional topics', 'Management of computing and information systems', 'Project and people management', 'Systems analysis and design']"

TRACK may be used to generate multiple visualizations of programs which may be concurrently run. It is a browsing and debugging tool as well as an algorithm animation tool. TRACK is tightly integrated with the standard tools of the SMALL- TALK-80 programming environment.,2,March 1990  ,Article ,CHI '90: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Computer graphics', 'Graphics systems and interfaces', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction devices', 'Graphics input devices', 'Software and its engineering', 'Software creation and management', 'Software verification and validation', 'Process validation', 'Traceability', 'Software notations and tools', 'Development frameworks and environments', 'Integrated and visual development environments', 'General programming languages', 'Language types']"

557,Designers: meet your users (panel),['S. Joy Mountford'],https://doi.org/10.1145/97243.97321,"Too few interface designers actually use an iterative design process. Too few interface designers actually involve their anticipated users throughout the design of an interface. In order to build better interfaces, we need to build faster and more numerous prototypical interface examples. These prototypes, from early sketches to working systems, should be shown frequently and often to users for their feedback. This panel is a vignette that illustrates an interface design cycle. Our panelists will be given a real world interface design problem, and the audience will follow them through their usual process of design. Users will be involved in the process, to help in interface specification and to provide prototype feedback. We expect that although the panelists involved users throughout their design process, users will still have a good deal more to contribute to the interface design before a product is finalized. On stage we will witness real users, with varied backgrounds, providing comments and feedback on the working prototypes. The issue here is to remind designers that there is never enough user involvement in an interface design. We need to iterate our interface designs, based on users' feedback, more often and continuously if our interfaces are to be effective,",1,March 1990  ,Article ,CHI '90: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Social and professional topics', 'Professional topics', 'Computing industry', 'Management of computing and information systems', 'Project and people management', 'Systems analysis and design', 'Software and its engineering', 'Software notations and tools', 'Development frameworks and environments']"

Informal communication is traditionally mediated by physical proximity, but physical proximity cannot mediate in geographically distributed organizations. The research described here evaluates the adequacy of a version of a desktop video/audio conferencing system for supporting informal communication in a research and development laboratory. The evaluation took place during a trial in which the  system was used by summer employees and their supervisor-mentors. While the system was used frequently, the most common uses and users' assessments suggest that it was used more like a telephone or electronic mail than like physically mediated face-to-face communication.

The surface of the water represents the cutting plane. Adjustment of the pool depth combined with direct manipulation of the object provides for arbitrary positioning of the cutting-plane.

While there is a clear need for task models in IR to account for situational determinants of user behaviour, what is required are hybrid models that take account of both is “planned” and “situated” aspects.

The survey was widely distributed, and we received 74 responses. The results show that in today's applications, an average of 48% of the code is devoted to the user interface portion. The average time spent on the user interface portion is 45% during the design phase, 50% during the implementation phase, and 37% during the maintenance phase. 34% of the systems were implemented using a toolkit, 27% used a UIMS, 14% used an interface builder, and 26% used no tools. This appears to be because the toolkit systems had more sophisticated user interfaces. The projects using UIMSs or interface builders spent the least percent of time and code on the user interface (around 41%) suggesting that these tools are effective. In general, people were happy with the tools they used, especially the graphical interface builders. The most common problems people reported when developing a user interface included getting users' requirements, writing help text, achieving consistency, learning how to use the tools, getting acceptable performance, and communicating among various parts of the program.",192,June 1992  ,Article ,CHI '92: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction paradigms', 'Interactive systems and tools', 'User interface management systems', 'Software and its engineering', 'Software notations and tools', 'Development frameworks and environments', 'Integrated and visual development environments']"

Textures synthesized using Gabor function primitives can be modulated along the three primary dimensions. Some preliminary results from a study using Gabor functions to modulate luminance are presented which suggest that: perceived texture size difference are approximately logarithmic, a 5% change in texton size is detectable 50% of the time, and large perceived size differences do not predict small (just noticeable) size differences.",11,June 1992  ,Article ,CHI '92: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer vision', 'Computer vision representations', 'Appearance and texture representations', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'HCI theory, concepts and models', 'Interaction design', 'Interaction design theory, concepts and paradigms']"

In most cases the reader has to gain the corresponding knowledge by effortful cognitive processes. This means adding to the cognitive load leaving less attentional capacity for the main task at hand.

Designers construct user interfaces by choosing and laying out widgets, then connectimg them to application semantics. This approach has four problems. First, most widgets are too low-level; constructing interfaces from them takes too much work. Second, working with widgets focuses attention on appearance and layout issues, rather than on more important semantic design issues. Third, designers can easily make poor widget choices, yielding poor interfaces. Fourth, widgets do not mesh well with application semantics; they know nothing about the variables they control. We are developing an application construction environment in which designers and implementers work with semantic-based controls called Selectors rather than with widgets. Selectors are classified according to their interface semantics (e.g., mutually-exclusive choice), rather than their appearance. Each type of Selector can be presented in a variety of ways; this may be chosen semi-automatically. Selectors mesh well with application semantics: their values are application data-types and their views determine how to present valid values automatically.",18,June 1992  ,Article ,CHI '92: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction paradigms', 'Interactive systems and tools', 'User interface management systems', 'Software and its engineering', 'Software notations and tools', 'Development frameworks and environments', 'Integrated and visual development environments']"

Today the electronic medium offers a number of advantages over paper, but it has not eradicated paper from the office. A growing problem for those who work primarily with paper is lack of direct access to the wide variety of interactive functions available on personal workstations. This paper describes a desk with a computer-controlled projector and camera above it.  The result is a system that enables people to interact with ordinary paper documents in ways normally possible only with electronic documents on workstation screens. After discussing the motivation for this work, this paper describes the system and two sample applications that can benefit from this style of interaction: a desk calculator and a French to English translation system. We describe the design and implementation of the system, report on some user tests, and conclude with some general reflections on interacting with computers in this way.",86,June 1992  ,Article ,CHI '92: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Applied computing', 'Enterprise computing', 'Enterprise information systems', 'Enterprise applications', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction devices', 'Touch screens', 'Interaction paradigms', 'Information systems', 'Information systems applications', 'Enterprise information systems', 'Enterprise applications', 'Multimedia information systems', 'Social and professional topics', 'Professional topics', 'Computing and business', 'Automation']"

We show how an interactive tool that employs this technique makes it possible for users to define sets of constraints graphically that modify existing illustrations or control the creation of new illustrations. The interace uses the same visual language as the editor and allows users to understand and create powerful rules without conventional programming. Rules can be saved and retrieved for use alone or in combination.

Piles were seen as complementary to the folder filing system, which was used for more formal archiving. A new desktop interface element–the pile– was developed and prototyped through an iterative process. The design includes direct manipulation techniques and support for browsing, and goes beyond physical world functionality by providing system assistance for automatic pile construction and reorganization.

We discuss some of the relative merits of this mode of viewing as compared to head mounted stereo displays. In addition, we report the experimental investigation of the following variables: 1) whether or not the perspective view is coupled to the actual viewpoint of the observer, 2) whether stereopsis is employed. Experiment 1 involved the subjective comparison of pairs of viewing conditions and the results suggest that head coupling may be more important than stereo in yielding a strong impression of three dimensionality. Experiment 2 involved subjects  tracing a path from a leaf of a 3D tree to the correct root (there were two trees intermeshed). The error rates ranged from 22% in the pictorial display, to 1.3% in the head coupled stereo display. The error rates for stereo alone and head coupling alone were 14.7% and 3.2% respectively.

As the user moves the FOA across a display via a pointing device, a smart cursor operates proactively on the data, highlighting objects which satisfy the current contest. The FOA permits foveal emphasis, enabling the user to vary motor precision with image clutter. HMPC provides for contexts at four levels of abstraction.

These results imply extensions to the Keystroke Level Model of skilled performance as well as suggest ways to design the user interfaces so as to speed the acquisition of expertise.",20,May 1993  ,Article ,CHI '93: Proceedings of the INTERACT '93 and CHI '93 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Applied computing', 'Enterprise computing', 'Enterprise information systems', 'Enterprise applications', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interaction paradigms', 'Information systems', 'Information systems applications', 'Enterprise information systems', 'Enterprise applications', 'Social and professional topics', 'Professional topics', 'Computing and business', 'Automation', 'Management of computing and information systems', 'Project and people management', 'Computer and information systems training']"

In our view, the addition of help is harmful, because communication with the system is more complex as a result, whereas the help hardly provides the task support that novices need.De Greef et al. [5] provide two design principles that result in consistent communication and aiding in  correspondence with users' needs: (i) the design of aiding functions is an integrated part of interface design and (ii) aiding is based upon an expert model of the users' task.

On the basis of these two features, we then propose a design space and a method for classifying multimodal systems.

To this point only case study support for this method has been given. There are still many unanswered questions about the effectiveness of this method.One difficulty encountered in user interface design is knowing what set of knowledge and skill the designer must possess to ensure good user interface design. Many different people have designed user interfaces for computer systems. These people came from a variety of backgrounds and viewpoints. Two of the most common groups involved in user interface design are human factors specialists and programmers.This study investigates these two issues. One factor in this study is the iterative design methodology. An empirical evaluation of this method was conducted. The strengths and weaknesses of this method are discussed. A second factor in this study is a comparison of human factors specialists and programmers in an actual user interface design task.The results of this study indicate that iterative design methodology can improve the usability of a product. The amount of the improvement may be constrained by the original design. This study also supports the use of human factors specialists in user interface design. A significant difference between designs produced by human factors specialists and programmers was found.,20,May 1993  ,Article ,CHI '93: Proceedings of the INTERACT '93 and CHI '93 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'HCI design and evaluation methods', 'Software and its engineering', 'Software creation and management', 'Software development process management', 'Software development methods', 'Rapid application development', 'Software development techniques', 'Software prototyping']"

Results of early tests can provide estimates of the number of problems left to be found and the number of additional evaluations needed to find a given fraction. With quantitative evaluation costs and detection values, the model can estimate the numbers of evaluations at which optimal cost/benefit ratios are obtained and at which marginal utility vanishes.

As many of us develop systems, we find that the concept of user involvement is not so easy to implement. Does one always strive to involve the user in the design process? Are there situations when the users should not be involved? What if the user is reluctant to change? How is user involvement handled when the user claims to know all the answers and wants to design the entire interface his or her way? What if the users, or even potential users are not available? How can user involvement be accomplished under these developmental restrictions?User Involvement, therefore, may be a goal - not a given, and how to effect user involvement is not as straight forward as the text books  convey!To assist the process of user interface development, many techniques have been developed such as Heuristic Evaluation, Participatory Design, Cognitive Walk Throughs, Task Analysis and Rapid Prototyping. These techniques vary considerably in the extent of user involvement that they require. This panel will attempt to match the technique with the degree of user involvement that the developer is faced with or can achieve.The issues discussed in this session are important to the entire user interface community.

In this paper we show how a better understanding of what is meant by the interface is possible via the concept of abstraction levels. We show how this levels approach can clarify some ambiguities, and also how it can be related to different phases in the evolution of the human-computer interaction field itself.

Desmarais', 'Jiming Liu']",https://doi.org/10.1145/169059.169243,"An adaptive user interface relies, to a large extent, upon an adequate user model (e.g., a representation of user-expertise). However, building a user model may be a tedious and time consuming task that will render such an interface unattractive to developers. We thus need an effective means of inferring the user model at low cost. In this paper, we describe a technique for automatically inferring a fine-grain model of a user's knowledge state based on a small number of observations. With this approach, the domain of knowledge to be evaluated is represented as a network of nodes (knowledge units—KU) and links (implications) induced from empirical user profiles. The user knowledge state is specified as a set of weights attached to the knowledge units that indicate the likelihood  of mastery. These weights are updated every time a knowledge unit is reassigned a new weight (e.g., by a question-and-answer process). The updating scheme is based on the Dempster-Shafer algorithm. A User Knowledge Assessment Tool (UKAT) that employs this technique has been implemented. By way of simulations we explore an entropy-based method of choosing questions, and compare the results with a random sampling method. The experimental results show that the proposed knowledge assessment and questioning methods are useful and efficient in inferring detailed models of user-expertise, but the entropy-based method can induce a bias in some circumstances.",6,May 1993  ,Article ,CHI '93: Proceedings of the INTERACT '93 and CHI '93 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Knowledge representation and reasoning', 'Machine learning', 'Machine learning approaches', 'Rule learning', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'HCI design and evaluation methods', 'HCI theory, concepts and models', 'Interaction design', 'Interaction design theory, concepts and paradigms', 'Information systems', 'Information systems applications', 'Decision support systems', 'Expert systems']"

In an observational study of a medical reception worksystem, three different types of plan were identified: the task plan, the procedure plan and the activity plan. These three types of plan were required for effective working in the domain of medical reception, because of the many similar concurrent tasks, the frequency of behaviour switching between tasks, the frequency of behaviour switching between tasks and the need for consistency within the worksystem. It is proposed, therefore, that to design effective interactive human-computer worksystems for the domain of medical reception (and possibly for other work domains of a similar nature), the designer must specify the three different types of plan and the relationships between them. The three types of plan in medical reception are discussed in the context of design issues such as the allocation of planning structures.",3,May 1993  ,Article ,CHI '93: Proceedings of the INTERACT '93 and CHI '93 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Applied computing', 'Life and medical sciences', 'Health care information systems', 'Computing methodologies', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Philosophical/theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence', 'Cognitive science', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'HCI design and evaluation methods']"

In contrast to talking heads video, we studied video-as-data in which video images of the workspace and work objects are the focus of interest, and convey critical information about the work. The use of video-as-data is intended to enhance task performance, rather than to provide telepresence. We studied the use of video during neurosurgery within the operating room and at remote locations away from the operating room. The workspace shown in the video is the surgical field (brain or spine) that the surgeon is operating on.

The Chiron user interface development system has been built to address these software engineering concerns. Chiron introduces a series of layers that insulate components of an application from other components that may experience change. To separate application code from user interface code, user interface agents called artists are attached to application abstract data types. Operations on abstract data types within the application implicitly trigger user interface activities. Chiron also provides insulation between the user interface layer and the underlying system; artist   code is written in terms of abstract depiction libraries that insulate the code from the specifics of particular windowing systems and toolkits. Concurrency is pervasive in the Chiron architecture. Inside an application there can be multiple execution threads; there is no requirement for a user interface listening/dispatching routine to have exclusive control. Multiple artists can be attached to a single application abstract data type, providing alternative forms of access by a single user or coordinated access and manipulation by multiple users.",19,May 1993  ,Article ,CHI '93: Proceedings of the INTERACT '93 and CHI '93 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'Interactive systems and tools', 'User interface management systems', 'Software and its engineering', 'Software notations and tools', 'Development frameworks and environments', 'Integrated and visual development environments', 'General programming languages', 'Language types']"

In this paper, we discuss an application model which captures information about the application to specifications of a desired interface.

Tasks were tested using three different input devices: a mouse, a trackball, and a tablet-with-stylus. The trackball had the least degradation across hands in performing the tasks, however it remained inferior to both the mouse and stylus. For small distances and small targets, the preferred hand was superior. However, for larger targets and larger distances, both hands performed about the same. The experiment shows that the non-preferred hand is more than a poor approximation of the preferred hand. The hands are complementary, each having its own strength and weakness. One design implication is that the non-preferred hand is well suited for tasks that do not require precise action, such as scrolling.",58,May 1993  ,Article ,CHI '93: Proceedings of the INTERACT '93 and CHI '93 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'HCI theory, concepts and models', 'Interaction devices', 'Touch screens', 'Interaction paradigms', 'Interaction design', 'Interaction design theory, concepts and paradigms']"

A hierarchic marking menu uses hierarchic radial menus and “zig-zag” marks to select from the hierarchy. This paper experimentally investigates the bounds on how many items can be in each level, and how deep the hierarchy can be, before using a marking to select an item becomes too slow or prone to errors.",135,May 1993  ,Article ,CHI '93: Proceedings of the INTERACT '93 and CHI '93 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'HCI design and evaluation methods', 'Interaction devices', 'Touch screens', 'Interaction paradigms']"

At the highest lag tested (225 ms), movement times and error rates increased by 64% and 214% respectively, compared to the zero lag condition. We propose a model according to which lag should have a multiplicative effect on Fitts' index of difficulty. The model accounts for 94% of the variance and is better than alternative models which propose only an additive effect for lag.

The decision of whether an informatin flow is permitted or denied depends on both the authorizations specified on the objects and the process by which information is obtained and transmitted. Depending on the specific computations, a process accessing sensitive information could still be allowed to release information to users who are not allowed to directly acces it. Exceptions to the permissions and restrictions stated by the authorizations are specified by means of exceptions associated with methods. Two kinds of exceptions are considered: invoke exceptions, applicable during a method executin, and reply exceptins, applicable to the infomation returned by a method. Information flowing form one object into another or returned to the user is subject to the different exceptions specified for the methods enforcing the transmission. We formally characterized information transmission and flow in a transaction and define the conditins for safe information flow. We define security specifications and characterize safe information flows. We propose an approach to control unsafe flows and present an algorithm to enforce it.

evaluation and design are often approached from a single
perspective, with a technologically-, individually-, or
socially-centered focus. A study of Groupware Calendar Systems
(GCSs) highlights the need for a synthesis of these multiple
perspectives to fully understand the adoption challenges these
systems face. First, GCSs often replace existing calendar
artifacts, which can impact users calendaring habits and in turn
influence technology adoption decisions. Second, electronic
calendars have the potential to easily share contextualized
information publicly over the computer network, creating
opportunities for peer judgment about time allocation and raising
concerns about privacy regulation. However, this situation may also
support coordination by allowing others to make useful inferences
about ones schedule. Third, the technology and the social
environment are in a reciprocal, co-evolutionary relationship: the
use context is affected by the constraints and affordances of the
technology, and the technology also co-adapts to the environment in
important ways. Finally, GCSs, despite being below the horizon of
everyday notice, can affect the nature of temporal coordination

We believe that the problem is a deeply rooted set of assumptions
about how computer systems should be designed, and about who should
be doing that design.Human organizations are continually evolving to meet changing
circumstances of resource and need. In contrast, computers are
quite rigid, incapable of adaptation on their own. Therefore when
computer systems are incorporated into human organizations, those
organizations must adapt the computers to changing circumstances.
This adaptation is another human activity that technology should
support, but our design philosophies are oddly silent about it.This paper explores the origins of these problems in the norms
developed for managing human organizations, proposes partial
solutions that can be implemented with current systems technology,

the fingertip into the ear canal. A received signal is conveyed
from a wrist-mounted actuator to the ear canal via the hand and a
finger by bone conduction. The users voice is captured by a
microphone mounted on the inside of the wrist. All components of
Whisper can be mounted on the wrist, and usability does not de-
crease if the size of components is miniaturized. So, both
wearability and usability can be achieved together. The way Whisper
is operated is similar to that of an ordinary telephone handset.
Thus, onlookers may not look upon Whispers operation as talking to
oneself, even if the associated PDA is controlled by voice
commands. Whis- per is especially effective in a noisy environment.
Signals received via bone conduction can be heard clearly in the
presence of noise without raising the volume (-12 dB at noise = 90
dB(A) in comparison to cellular phone hand- set). Whisper is also
effective in avoiding the annoying problem of the users voice being
raised in a noisy situa- tion. Feedback of the users utterance is
boosted by bone conduction when covering the ear canal with a
fingertip, then the users voice does not need to raised in the
pres- ence of noise (-6 dB at noise = 90 dB(A) in comparison to
cellular phone handset). Whisper is useful as a voice interface for

technique that enables quick browsing of multimedia is
time-compression. Prior research has described how speech can be
time-compressed (shortened in duration) while preserving the pitch
of the audio. However, client-server systems providing this
functionality have not been available.In this paper, we first describe the key tradeoffs faced by
designers of streaming multimedia systems deploying
time-compression. The implementation tradeoffs primarily impact the
granularity of time-compression supported (discrete vs. continuous)

degree of time-compression. We report results of user studies
showing impact of these factors on the average- compression-rate
achieved. We also present data on the usage patterns and benefits

In most of those errors, the child was able to correct the problem
either easily (41.1% of the time) or with some effort (20.7%).
Natural-language errors were divided into five categories. In order
from most to least frequent, they are: syntax errors, guessing a
command name by supplying an arbitrary English word, literal
interpretation of metaphor, assuming the system is keeping more
state information than is actually the case, and errors of operator

traditional gaze pointing. In particular, it is unnatural to
overload a perceptual channel such as vision with a motor control
task. We therefore propose an alternative approach, dubbed MAGIC
(Manual And Gaze Input Cascaded) pointing. With such an approach,
pointing appears to the user to be a manual task, used for fine
manipulation and selection. However, a large portion of the cursor
movement is eliminated by warping the cursor to the eye gaze area,
which encompasses the target. Two specific MAGIC pointing
techniques, one conservative and one liberal, were designed,
analyzed, and implemented with an eye tracker we developed. They
were then tested in a pilot study. This early- stage exploration
showed that the MAGIC pointing techniques might offer many
advantages, including reduced physical effort and fatigue as
compared to traditional manual pointing, greater accuracy and
naturalness than traditional gaze pointing, and possibly faster
speed than manual pointing. The pros and cons of the two techniques

view these notes with browsers that allow them to retrieve all
notes taken in a given context or to access notes from other
related notes or documents. This is possible because NotePals
records the context in which each note is created (e.g., its
author, subject, and creation time). The system is lightweight
because it fits easily into group members regular note- taking
practices, and uses informal, ink-based user interfaces that run on
portable, inexpensive hardware. In this paper we describe NotePals,

itself, researchers are attempting to learn how to combine
different modes into strategically integrated whole systems. In
theory, well designed multimodal systems should be able to
integrate complementary modalities in a manner that supports mutual
disambiguation (MD) of errors and leads to more robust performance.
In this study, over 2,000 multimodal utterances by both native and
accented speakers of English were processed by a multimodal system,
and then logged and analyzed. The results confirmed that multimodal
systems can indeed support significant levels of MD, and also
higher levels of MD for the more challenging accented users. As a
result, although speech recognition as a stand-alone performed far
more poorly for accented speakers, their multimodal recognition
rates did not differ from those of native speakers. Implications
are discussed for the development of future multimodal
architectures that can perform in a more robust and stable manner
than individual recognition technologies. Also discussed is the
design of interfaces that support diversity in tangible ways, and
that function well under challenging real-world usage

users with good typing skills. Furthermore, while users initially
prefer speech, they learn to avoid ineffective correction
modalities with experience. To extrapolate results from this user

A symmetric bimanual task is a two-handed task in which each hand is assigned an identical role. In this context, we explore three main experimental factors. We vary the distance between the pair of targets to track: as the targets become further apart, visual diversion increases, forcing the user to divide attention between the two targets. We also vary the demands of the task by using both a slow and a fast tracking speed. Finally, we explore visual integration of sub-tasks: in one condition, the two targets to track are connected by a line segment which visually links the targets, while in the other condition there is no connecting line. Our results indicate that all three experimental factors affect the degree of parallelism, which we quantify using a new metric of bimanual parallelism.

Results of our experiments indicate that people can accurately and quickly select among a small numbers of buttons on the PDA using the left hand without looking, and that, as predicted, performance does decrease as the number of buttons increases. Homing times to move both hands between the keyboard and devices are only about 10% to 15% slower than times to move a single hand to the mouse, suggesting that acquiring two devices does not cause a large penalty. In an application task, we found that scrolling web pages using buttons or a scroller on the PDA matched the speed of using a mouse with a conventional scroll bar, and beat the best two-handed times reported in an earlier experiment.

Going through three years of CHI Proceedings, we find that 11 out of 19 experimental studies involving complex tasks account for only one or two aspects of usability. When these studies make claims concerning overall usability, they rely on risky assumptions about correlations between usability aspects. Unless domain specific studies suggest otherwise, effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction should be considered independent aspect of usability and all be included in usability testing.",160,April 2000  ,Article ,CHI '00: Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)', 'HCI design and evaluation methods', 'Information systems', 'Information retrieval', 'Social and professional topics', 'Professional topics', 'Management of computing and information systems', 'Implementation management']"

The challenge in designing good gestures is to make them easy for people to learn and remember. With the goal of better gesture design, we performed a pair of experiments to determine why users find gestures similar. From these experiments, we have derived a computational model for predicting perceived gesture similarity that correlates 0.56 with observation.

Interface techniques specialized to recognition systems can help reduce the burden of recognition errors, but building these interfaces depends on knowledge about the ambiguity inherent in recognition. We have extended a user interface toolkit in order to model and to provide structured support for ambiguity at the input event level. This makes it possible to build re-usable interface components for resolving ambiguity and dealing with recognition errors. These interfaces can help to reduce the negative effects of recognition errors. By providing these components at a toolkit level, we make it easier for application writers to provide good support for error handling. Further, with this robust support, we are able to explore new types of interfaces for resolving a more varied range of ambiguity.",62,April 2000  ,Article ,CHI '00: Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"['Computing methodologies', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Knowledge representation and reasoning', 'Cognitive robotics', 'Natural language processing', 'Speech recognition', 'Philosophical/theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence', 'Cognitive science', 'Human-centered computing', 'Human computer interaction (HCI)']"

User control of the rollers proceeds by manipulating a force feedback trackball. Tactual and auditory cues strengthen the roller impression and support use without a visual display. The evaluation investigated task performance and procedural learning when performing music programming tasks with and without a visual display. No procedural instructions were provided. Tasks could be completed successfully with and without a visual display, though programming without a display needed more time to complete. Prior experience with a visual display did not improve performance without a visual display.

A correct perspective view of a virtual environment enables normal eye-hand co-ordination skills to be applied. But is it necessary for rapid interaction with 3D objects? A study of rapid hand movements is reported using an apparatus designed so that the user can touch a virtual object in the same place where he or she sees it. A Fitts tapping task is used to assess the effect of both contact with virtual objects and real-time update of the centre of perspective based on the user's actual eye position. A Polhemus tracker is used to measure the user's head position and from this estimate their eye position. In half of the conditions, head tracked perspective is employed so that visual feedback is accurate while in the other half a fixed eye-position is assumed. A Phantom force feedback device is used to make it possible to touch the targets in selected conditions. Subjects were required to change their viewing position periodically to assess the importance of correct perspective and of touching the targets in maintaining eye-hand co-ordination, The results show that accurate perspective improves performance by an average of 9% and contact improves it a further 12%.

Ten adults performed eighty steering tasks, where the participants moved the cursor through a small tunnel with varying indices of difficulty using a conventional and force-feedback mouse. For the force-feedback condition, the mouse displayed force that pulled the cursor to the center of the tunnel. The tasks required both horizontal and vertical screen movements of the cursor. Movement times were on average 52 percent faster during the force-feedback condition when compared to the conventional mouse. Furthermore, for the conventional mouse vertical movements required more time to complete than horizontal screen movements. Another ten adults completed a combined steering and targeting task, where the participants navigated through a tunnel and then clicked a small box at the end of the tunnel. Again, force-feedback improved times to complete the task.

Unlike movement time, error rate, and throughput, which are based on a single measurement per trial, the new measures capture aspects of movement behaviour during a trial. The theoretical basis and computational techniques for the measures are described, with examples given. An evaluation with four pointing devices was conducted to validate the measures.

Differences in disturbance were examined as a function of simultaneous exposure to an “independent visual background” (IVB). Eight subjects were tested at two scene motion frequencies and three different IVB conditions using a within-subjects design. An expected statistically significant interaction between IVB condition and frequency was observed.

The proposed approach centers on integrating a user model for the interface with an existing driver model that accounts for basic aspects of driver behavior (e.g., steering and speed control). By running the integrated model and having it interact with the interface while driving, we can generate a priori predictions of the effects of interface use on driver performance.

Nineteen participants listened to six, pre-recorded, desktop conferences. Each conference was presented using either non-spatial audio, co-located spatial audio, or scaled spatial audio, and during half of the conferences, static visual representations of the conferees were present. In the co-located condition, each conferees voice originated from directly above their image on the screen, and in the scaled spatial audio condition, the spatial separation between conferee voices was increased beyond the visual separation. Results showed that spatial audio improved all measures, increasing memory, focal assurance, and perceived comprehension. In addition, participants preferred spatial audio to non-spatial audio.

Audio recordings are structured using two techniques: user structuring based on notetaking activity, and acoustic structuring based on a talker's changes in pitch, pausing, and energy. A field study showed that the interaction techniques enabled a range of usage styles, from detailed review to high speed skimming.

It was found that movement time was slower when visual feedback of the moving limb was not available. Further MT varied systematically with target size when haptic feedback was available (i.e. augmented targets), and thus followed Fitts' law. However, movement times were constant regardless of target size when haptic feedback was removed. In depth analysis of the reaching kinematics revealed that subjects spent longer decelerating toward smaller targets in conditions where  haptic feedback was available.

One barrier to achieving this vision has been the design of low-cost camera systems that can capture important aspects of the meeting without needing a human camera operator. A promising solution that has emerged recently is omni-directional cameras that can capture a 360-degree video of the entire meeting.The panoramic capability provided by these cameras raises both new opportunities and new issues for the interfaces provided for post-meeting viewers — for example, do we show all meeting participants all the time or do we just show the person who is speaking, how much  control do we provide to the end-user in selecting the view, and will providing this control distract them from their task. These are not just user interface issues, they also raise tradeoffs for the client-server systems used to deliver such content. They impact how much data needs to be stored on the disk, what computation can be done on the server vs. the client, and how much bandwidth is needed.
